The IcMM is comprised of three sub-models: the pull, push, and distance impedance models. The IcMM simulates two-way inter-city migration based on cities' pull factors, push factors, and distance impedance. The IcMM is a strict implementation of the ""push-pull"" theory. Model verification shows that it can achieve good results in simulating China's inter-city migration. The three sub-models included in the IcMM are loosely coupled and easy to expand.

In this study, we conducted a multiregional computable general equilibrium simulation analysis to assess the effects that the proposed 2027 high-speed railway, the Linear Chuo Shinkansen in Japan, will have on population migration. The 47 prefectures ordained by the Japanese administrative unit were considered, and the simulation potential workforce population was taken as 110 million. The population is concentrated in the Tokyo metropolitan area. As per our simulation, once the proposed high-speed railway opens, ""travel costs"" (comprising time and the monetary costs of traveling) will decrease. This situation will stimulate economic activities and lead people to migrate to the prefectures where the economic environment improves. The results show that this development will ease extreme population concentration while simultaneously increasing employment and production values.

Asa well-known model that captures social trust dilemmas, the Nplayer trust game is adopted to investigate the evolution of trust in groups consisting of investors and trustees. In addition, to model real scenarios in dynamic environments, we introduce a novel migration mechanism, called adaptive environment-benefit-driven migration, which considers the influence of individuals' payoffs on migration. Through theoretical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the migration mechanism on facilitating trust behaviors in the framework of evolutionary game theory. We find that the population density plays a crucial role in establishing trust.

We call this model the (3, 3) parallel migration-selection (ParaMiSe) model. The individuals on each island reproduce with the probability proportional to their fitness values and die at random, and migrate between two islands. The evolutionary dynamics of the (3, 3) ParaMiSe model is formulated as a master equation and can be approximated as the Fokker-Planck equation and the stochastic differential equations (SDEs). By taking the infinite population limit, we obtain the deterministic parts of the SDEs and observe that there exists a second-order continuous phase transition in the population density from the monomorphic state to the polymorphic state at the critical migration rate. We find the critical migration rate as a function of the median fitness value on the islands and predict the critical migration rate for the general (D, D) ParaMiSe model with D > 3.

However, limited by the nature of IBD, which could only capture the relationship between two individuals/haplotypes, existing IBD-based history inference is constrained to two populations. In this study, we propose a framework by leveraging IBD sharing in multipopulation and develop a method, MatrixIBD, to reconstruct recent multi-population migration history. Specifically, we employ the structured coalescent theory to precisely model the genealogical process and then estimate the IBD sharing across multiple populations. Within our model, we establish a theoretical connection between migration history and IBD sharing. Our method is rigorously evaluated through simulations, revealing its remarkable accuracy and robustness. Furthermore, we apply MatrixIBD to Central and South Asia in the Human Genome Diversity Project and successfully reconstruct the recent migration history of three closely related populations in South Asia. By taking into account the IBD sharing across multiple populations simultaneously, MatrixIBD enables us to attain clearer and more comprehensive insights into the history of regions characterized by complex migration dynamics, providing a holistic perspective on intricate patterns embedded within the recent population migration history.

[1]",Estimating pathogen spread using structured coalescent and birth-death models: A quantitative comparison,EPIDEMICS,DEC 2024,0,"Elucidating disease spread between subpopulations is crucial in guiding effective disease control efforts. Genomic epidemiology and phylodynamics have emerged as key principles to estimate such spread from pathogen phylogenies derived from molecular data. Two well-established structured phylodynamic methodologies - based on the coalescent and the birth-death model - are frequently employed to estimate viral spread between populations. Nonetheless, these methodologies operate under distinct assumptions whose impact on the accuracy of migration rate inference is yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this manuscript, we present a simulation study, contrasting the inferential outcomes of the structured coalescent model with constant population size and the multitype birth-death model with a constant rate. We explore this comparison across a range of migration rates in endemic diseases and epidemic outbreaks. The results of the epidemic outbreak analysis revealed that the birth-death model exhibits a superior ability to retrieve accurate migration rates compared to the coalescent model, regardless of the actual migration rate. Thus, to estimate accurate migration rates, the population dynamics have to be accounted for. On the other hand, for the endemic disease scenario, our investigation demonstrates that both models produce comparable coverage and accuracy of the migration rates, with the coalescent model generating more precise estimates. Regardless of the specific scenario, both models similarly estimated the source location of the disease. This research offers tangible modelling advice for infectious disease analysts, suggesting the use of either model for endemic diseases. For epidemic outbreaks, or scenarios with varying population size, structured phylodynamic models relying on the Kingman coalescent with constant population size should be avoided as they can lead to inaccurate estimates of the migration rate. Instead, coalescent models accounting for varying population size or birth-death models should be favoured. Importantly, our study emphasises the value of directly capturing exponential growth dynamics which could be a useful enhancement for structured coalescent models.",Author KeywordsPhylodynamicsPhylogeneticsPathogen spreadBirth-deathCoalescentKeywords PlusDYNAMICSMIGRATION

[1]",Benefits to migratory fish populations of entrainment and its potential role in fisheries collapse,ICES JOURNAL OF MARINE SCIENCE,JAN-FEB 2021,1,"According to the entrainment hypothesis, traditional migratory routes develop in fish populations through social interactions. First-time migrants learn migratory routes by following experienced conspecifics and, by repeating the migration, contribute to guiding future cohorts along the same route. The loss of collective memory of migratory routes may be a precursor to fisheries collapse. The survival value of entrainment has not been convincingly demonstrated, and this possibly explains why there has not been greater interest in this putative migratory mechanism. I propose that the relative frequency of demonstrators of alternative contingents provides information to first-time migrants on relative survival rates. Using simulation, I show that a population in which contingent adoption is regulated by entrainment can achieve higher overall survival rates than a comparable population with fixed rates of contingent adoption in the situation where mortality rates differ among contingents. In certain cases, the advantage could be even larger in the presence of fishing mortality. I also compare the responses of the entrainment-based and fixed-rate migration populations in a scenario intended to mimic the cessation of fishing after a period of high fishing mortality, such as might occur after the collapse of a fishery.",Author Keywordsentrainmentfisheries collapsemigrationsimulation studyKeywords PlusSOUTHERN BLUEFIN TUNACOD GADUS-MORHUADECISION-MAKINGDYNAMICSECOLOGYSTOCKCONNECTIVITYBEHAVIOR

Row_17,"Kahn, Ethan",Assessing the Effects of Health-Selective Internal Migration on Spatial Inequality in the United States: A Simulation-Based Analysis,University of Washington,2023,0,"Background: There are vast geographic and racial disparities in disability prevalence across the United States. Some geographic inequalities may be artifacts of health-selective internal migration, and it is unclear to what extent this migration influences the association between local characteristics and health outcomes. Accurately identifying the causes of disability is crucial to develop policies that reduce disparities in disability prevalence. Aims: This study measured how much internal migration contributes to spatial patterns of disability prevalence in the United States for the whole population and separately for five racial-ethnic groups. Methods: We ran a microsimulation of the US population aged 45 years and above and produced age-standardized estimates of disability prevalence in 976 substate locations between 2012 and 2019. By comparing patterns of disability prevalence with and without migration, we demonstrated the influence of migration on spatial inequality for the whole population and five racial-ethnic groups. Migration in the simulation was parameterized using generalized linear mixed effects models fit on the American Community Survey Public Use Microdata Sample. Additional parameters were derived from the National Health Interview Survey and previously published estimates. Results: We found that adults with disabilities were more likely to move compared to those without disabilities (3.4% vs 2.7% annually). Migration affected the prevalence of disability in most locations, but the effect was highly variable. The mean absolute difference in location-specific disability prevalence in 2019 with migration compared to the scenario without migration was 0.9 percentage points, with a mean absolute relative difference of 2.8%. Migration marginally increased the variation in disability prevalence across locations. Migration slightly exacerbated inequalities for minoritized racial-ethnic groups across areas classified by urbanicity and median income, although this pattern was not found for the White population or the total population. Conclusion: Disability is associated with whether and where adults move in the United States. However, health-selective internal migration does not substantially alter the spatial distribution of disability prevalence in the United States and only slightly affects the association between area-level income or urban-rural classification and disability prevalence. Nonetheless, migration meaningfully increased or decreased the disability prevalence in some areas, especially for minoritized racial-ethnic groups, so analyses of spatial inequality should consider the influence of migration on disability prevalence.",

Oceanic islands, such as Easter Island (EI) and the Salas & Gomez Island (SG), are ideal for the study of population connectivity because they are separated by 415 km and isolated from other islands in the Pacific Ocean by >2000 km. Considering that the dispersal process could play a critical role in the persistence of their populations, we evaluated the connectivity pattern of the endemic gastropod Monetaria caputdraconis between EI and SG using population genetics and biophysical modelling. Eleven microsatellite loci did not show differences in the allelic frequency of individuals located in EI and SG, suggesting the presence of one genetic population. Historical reciprocal migration implies that 0.49% of the recruits in EI come from SG and 0.37% in SG come from EI. Considering year-round larval release and a larval development of 2 weeks in the plankton, a Lagrangian experiment based on a regional oceanic simulation indicated a weak population connectivity with a high rate of self-recruitment. Interestingly, self-recruitment showed both monthly and interannual variation ranging from 1 to 45% of returned larvae, with lower values estimated in SG compared to EI. The results suggest that few larvae/individuals arrive at each other's island, possibly due to stochastic events, such as rafting.

This article explores these questions using an agent-based model, a computational simulation that allows us to connect armed conflict to individual behavioral changes and then to aggregate migration flows and migrant stocks. With detailed data from Nepal during the 1996-2006 conflict, we find that out-migration rates actually decrease on average, largely due to a prior decrease in return migration. Regardless, the stock of migrants outside the country increases modestly during that period. Broadly, this study demonstrates that population dynamics are inherent to and necessary for understanding conflict-related migration.

Despite the substantial research work in cooperative breeding birds, the dependence of the population dynamics is unidentified on young or adult helpers in migratory populations. The existing mathematical models mostly ignore the migratory property for predicting the birds' cooperative dynamics. The cooperative breeding birds have three groups in their population, viz, immature or primary helpers, mature or secondary helpers, and breeders. We ask three questions to study migratory cooperative birds' population structure and dynamics through mathematical modeling under changing environments. Which group is the key to the population dynamics of cooperative migratory birds? Does the mature helper compensate young helpers' helping? Does the hierarchical structure of the population vary for variable migratory rates? We explore the answers based on the mathematical model's simulation experiment, a potential alternative to the game theory approach. This study estimates the parameters associated with the proposed model through the field survey and obtains the rest from existing literature. Although the study uses blue-tailed bee-eater as the test-bed species, the model is helpful for analyzing other avian species' behavioral property. The model as a tool can determine whether the primary helpers of blue-tailed bee-eater are the key to population dynamics.

Households tend to reduce labor allocation for migration to retain essential croplands after abandonment of marginal ones. For the reforestation program, participating households are more resilient in maintaining migration than non-participants. The model reveals the feedback mechanisms between the two concurrent PES programs through synergistic and offsetting interactions. Specifically, labor migration under higher payments of one program is more sensitive to payments of the other due to the feedback of additional cropland abandonment induced by the former program.ConclusionsUsing the real-world landscape and in-situ socio-economic settings, the integrated model captures the dynamics of the social-ecological systems affected by PES across space and time.",Author KeywordsAgent-based modelingCoupled human and natural systemsEcological restorationForest conservationLabor migrationLand use changeKeywords PlusECOSYSTEM SERVICESLAND-USECOUPLED HUMANENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONSPAYMENTSCHINASYSTEMSFORESTFRAMEWORKLESSONS

In our simulations, Neptune unlocks from resonance with the other giant planets and begins to migrate outward due to interactions with planetesimals before a planetary orbital instability is triggered, and afterward, residual Neptunian migration completes the formation of the modern Kuiper belt. Our present work exhibits a number of notable differences from prior work. First, Neptune's planetary resonance unlocking requires the Neptunian 3:2 mean motion resonance to sweep much of the primordial disk interior to 30 au prior to the giant planet instability. The pre-instability population of planetesimals is consequently lower in semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination, and this effect persists after the instability. Second, direct scattering between Pluto-mass bodies and other small bodies removes material from Neptunian resonances more efficiently than resonant dropout resulting from small changes in Neptune's semimajor axis during scattering between Pluto-mass bodies and Neptune. Thus, the primordial population of Pluto-mass bodies may be as few as ~200 objects. Finally, our simulation end states display a wide variety of orbital distributions, and clear relationships between final bulk Kuiper belt properties and Neptune's migration or initial planetesimal properties largely elude us. In particular, we find that the rapid, stochastic planetary orbital evolution occurring during the giant planet instability can significantly alter final Kuiper belt properties such as its inclination dispersion and the prominence of resonant populations.

Recent studies show two striking features of this region: 1) a very large population of objects in distant mean-motion resonances with Neptune, and 2) the existence of a substantial detached population (non-resonant objects largely decoupled from Neptune). Neptune migration models are able to implant some resonant and detached objects during the planet migration era, but many fail to match a variety of aspects of the orbital distribution. In this work, we report simulations carried out using an improved version of the GPU-based code GLISSE, following 100,000 test particles per simulation in parallel while handling their planetary close encounters. We demonstrate for the first time that a 2 Earth-mass rogue planet temporarily present during planet formation can abundantly populate both the distant resonances and the detached populations, surprisingly even without planetary migration. We show how weak encounters with the rogue greatly increase the efficiency of filling the resonances, while also dislodging TNOs out of resonance once they reach high perihelia. The rogue's secular gravitational influence simultaneously generates numerous detached objects observed at all semimajor axes.

The simulations based on various scenarios show that the differences in migration across counties were responsible for the increased regional population disparity. Other factors, such as differences in marriage, marital fertility, and mortality, were not major determinants. Differences in the initial population distribution tended to reduce the disparity in county population. The results of age-specific analyses suggest that the differences in migration among younger persons (aged 20 to 39) were the primary cause of the increase in the disparity in county population.

Multi-scale bubbles migrated in the pipe while interacting with each other, causing coalescence and disintegration. The bubbles collided and coalesced, forming a new air pocket in the downward inclined pipe that blocked the transportation of both the gas and liquid phases. Consequently, the buoyance weakened the migration ability of the bubbles, which is known as re-coalescence. To investigate, a new transient model applied with the population balance model (PBM), and Eulerian-Lagrangian coupling scheme is proposed. The complex flow field was modeled using the Eulerian scheme, while the migration of the bubbles was designed in the Lagrangian mesh. Furthermore, the PBM was employed to describe the multi-scale bubble interaction and migration. Smooth particle hydrodynamics were applied to connect the bubble-dimension and pipe-dimension descriptions. Therefore, the bubble fraction could be described to predict the re-coalescence of air pockets. The required unknown model parameters were extracted from the published experimental data, while the simulation results corresponded well with the measured results. During the simulation, the effect of the liquid Froude number and pipe inclination on the size distribution of the multi-scale bubbles were investigated.

In these cases, genomic regions that are linked to a locally adapted locus experience reduced effective migration rates. Via individual-based simulations of a two-patch system, we show that this reduced effective migration results in the accumulation of conditionally deleterious mutations, but not universally deleterious mutations, adjacent to adaptive loci. When there is redundancy in the genetic basis of local adaptation (i.e., genotypic redundancy), turnover of locally adapted polymorphisms allows conditionally deleterious mutation load to be purged. The amount of mutational load that accumulates adjacent to locally adapted loci is dependent on redundancy, recombination rate, migration rate, population size, strength of selection, and the phenotypic effect size of adaptive alleles. Our results highlight the need to be cautious when interpreting patterns of local adaptation at the level of phenotype or fitness, as the genetic basis of local adaptation can be transient, and evolution may confer a degree of maladaptation to nonlocal environments.",Author KeywordsmaladaptationSLiMlocal adaptationgene flow and genetic divergencedeleterious mutationsconditional neutralityKeywords PlusVARIABLE SELECTIONTRADE-OFFSFITNESSSPECIALIZATIONMAINTENANCE

Extensive studies have elucidated the different ways in which this phenomenon may arise. Nevertheless, how collective migration can persist when a population is confronted with perturbations, which inevitably arise in complex settings, is poorly understood. Here, by combining experiments and simulations, we describe a mechanism by which collectively migrating populations smooth out large-scale perturbations in their overall morphology, enabling their constituents to continue to migrate together. We focus on the canonical example of chemotactic migration of Escherichia coli, in which fronts of cells move via directed motion, or chemotaxis, in response to a self-generated nutrient gradient. We identify two distinct modes in which chemotaxis influences the morphology of the population: cells in different locations along a front migrate at different velocities due to spatial variations in (i) the local nutrient gradient and in (ii) the ability of cells to sense and respond to the local nutrient gradient. While the first mode is destabilizing, the second mode is stabilizing and dominates, ultimately driving smoothing of the overall population and enabling continued collective migration. This process is autonomous, arising without any external intervention; instead, it is a population-scale consequence of the manner in which individual cells transduce external signals. Our findings thus provide insights to predict, and potentially control, the collective migration and morphology of cell populations and diverse other forms of active matter.",local nutrient gradientcollective migrationchemotactic migration

The Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis) is a declining Nearctic-Neotropical migratory songbird, but limited information exists describing its population-specific migration ecology. We aimed to understand how individuals from a central Appalachian breeding population were spatially distributed during the stationary nonbreeding period, infer the strength and pattern of migratory connectivity, and understand migratory route patterns. We deployed 32 geolocator tags on adult male birds in 2020 and 10 tags retrieved in 2021 provided usable data. Stationary nonbreeding season locations suggest moderate population connectivity, with birds clustered on the Andean slopes on each side of the Magdalena Valley in northern Colombia. Post-breeding (boreal fall) migration was largely overland through Mexico and Central America, and pre-breeding (boreal spring) migration routes were significantly farther east based on the western most longitude recorded during migration (mean difference = 232 km), consistent with a pattern of counter clockwise loop migration.

Massive planets reduce the inflow of material from the outer to the inner disc, therefore triggering an earlier onset of disc dispersal due to PE through a process known as Planet-Induced PhotoEvaporation (PIPE). In this case, a cavity is formed as material inside the planetary orbit is removed by PE, leaving only the outer disc to drive the migration of the giant planet. We investigate the impact of PE on giant planet migration and focus specifically on the case of transition discs with an evacuated cavity inside the planet location. This is important for determining under what circumstances PE is efficient at halting the migration of giant planets, thus affecting the final orbital distribution of a population of planets. For this purpose, we use 2D FARGO simulations to model the migration of giant planets in a range of primordial and transition discs subject to PE. The results are then compared to the standard prescriptions used to calculate the migration tracks of planets in 1D planet population synthesis models. The FARGO simulations show that once the disc inside the planet location is depleted of gas, planet migration ceases. This contradicts the results obtained by the impulse approximation, which predicts the accelerated inward migration of planets in discs that have been cleared inside the planetary orbit. These results suggest that the impulse approximation may not be suitable for planets embedded in transition discs. A better approximation that could be used in 1D models would involve halting planet migration once the material inside the planetary orbit is depleted of gas and the surface density at the 3:2 mean motion resonance location in the outer disc reaches a threshold value of 0.01, g cm-2.",planet migration ceases1D planet population synthesis modelsplanet locationplanetary orbitinner discmassive planetstransition discsdisc dispersal phasegiant planet migrationouter disc

This paper extends the study of migration to examine the role of external influences using the example of the interaction of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Sgr) with the Milky Way (MW). We first make impulse approximation estimates to characterize the influence of Sgr disc passages. The tidal forcing from Sgr can produce changes in both guiding radius (DeltaRg) and orbital eccentricity, as quantified by the maximum radial excursion, DeltaRmax. These changes follow a quadrupole-like pattern across the face of the disc, with amplitude increasing with Galactocentric radius. We next examine a collisionless N-body simulation of a Sgr-like satellite interacting with a MW-like galaxy and find that Sgr's influence in the outer disc dominates over the secular evolution of orbits between disc passages. Finally, we use the same simulation to explore possible observable signatures of Sgr-induced migration by painting the simulation with different age stellar populations. We find that following Sgr disc passages, the migration it induces manifests within an annulus as an approximate quadrupole in azimuthal metallicity variations (delta[Fe/H]), along with systematic variations in orbital eccentricity, DeltaRmax. These systematic variations can persist for several rotational periods. We conclude that this combination of signatures may be used to distinguish between the different migration mechanisms shaping the chemical abundance patterns of the Milky Way's thin disc.",

This article models the potential scope of such movements for the emissions policy choices facing all nation-states today. Applying insights from climate science and computational modeling to migration research, we examine the likely surge of drought-induced migration and assess the prospects of different policy scenarios to mitigate involuntary displacement.

Our simulations suggest that a potential for drought-induced migration increases by approximately 200 percent under the current international policy scenario (corresponding to the current Paris Agreement targets). In contrast, total migration increases by almost 500 percent, should current international cooperation fail and should unrestricted policies toward greenhouse gas emissions prevail. We argue that despite the continued growth projections of drought-induced migration in all cases, international cooperation on climate change can substantially reduce the global potential for such migration, in contrast to unilateral policy approaches to energy demands.

Isolation by landscape resistance, often inferred through the use of circuit theory, is increasingly identified as being critical for predicting genetic connectivity across complex landscapes. Yet landscape impediments to migration can arise from fundamentally different processes, such as landscape gradients causing directional migration and mortality during migration, which can be challenging to address. Spatial absorbing Markov chains (SAMC) have been introduced to understand and predict these (and other) processes affecting connectivity in ecological settings, but the relationship of this framework to landscape genetics remains unclear. Here, we relate the SAMC to population genetics theory, provide simulations to interpret the extent to which the SAMC can predict genetic metrics and demonstrate how the SAMC can be applied to genomic data using an example with an endangered species, the Panama City crayfish Procambarus econfinae, where directional migration is hypothesized to occur. The use of the SAMC for landscape genetics can be justified based on similar grounds to using circuit theory, as we show how circuit theory is a special case of this framework. The SAMC can extend circuit-theoretic connectivity modelling by quantifying both directional resistance to migration and acknowledging the difference between migration mortality and resistance to migration. Our empirical example highlights that the SAMC better predicts population structure than circuit theory and least-cost analysis by acknowledging asymmetric environmental gradients (i.e. slope) and migration mortality in this species. These results provide a foundation for applying the SAMC to landscape genetics. This framework extends isolation-by-resistance modelling to account for some common processes that can impact gene flow, which can improve predicting genetic connectivity across complex landscapes.",Author Keywordscircuit theorygene flowlandscape geneticsMarkov chainsmovementKeywords PlusEFFECTIVE POPULATION-SIZEDISTANCEECOLOGYMODELS

Materials and Methods: Four kinship systems were simulated from a set of variable fertility and mortality scenarios. Initial conditions consisted of six clusters of variable size and a random number of assigned haplotypes, with individuals migrating between groups and reproducing for 15 generations. Each 15-generation span was simulated 500 times to obtain representative intrasite mtDNA diversity distributions for each kinship system. Additional simulations were devised to consider the effect of migration and different rates of adherence to kinship norms. Results: Matrilineal kinship generates low male and female haplotype diversities that are statistically indistinguishable from each other, while female diversity in bilateral kinship with matrilocality is significantly lower than that observed in male diversity. Furthermore, mtDNA diversity generated by patrilineal kinship is very high. The effect of noncompliance with kinship rules is low; migration has a considerable impact on diversity, eventually obscuring the effect of kinship practices. Discussion: The results of the simulations can be applied to ancient mtDNA data from archeological contexts, as exemplified with data from two studies. On a broader scale, the kinship system followed by the sampled population, can lead to either over- or underestimation of mtDNA population diversity.

In models for Neptune's migration involving a gravitational upheaval, this planetesimal-driven migration is a side-effect of the dynamical friction required to damp Neptune's orbital eccentricitiy. This migration is noisy, potentially causing Trans Neptunian Objects (TNOs) in mean motion resonance to be lost. With Nbody simulations, we validate a previously-derived analytic model for resonance retention and determine unknown coefficients. We identify the impact of random-walk (noisy) migration on resonance retention for resonances up to fourth order lying between 39 au and 75 au. Using a population estimate for the weak 7:3 resonance from the well-characterized Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS), we rule out two cases: (1) a planetesimal disk distributed between 13.3 and 39.9 au with $\gtrsim$ 30 Earth masses in today's size distribution and $T_{\rm mig} \gtrsim$ 40Myr and (2) a top-heavy size distribution with $\gtrsim$ 2000 Pluto-sized TNOs and $T_{\rm mig} \gtrsim$ 10Myr, where $T_{\rm mig}$ is Neptune's migration timescale. We find that low-eccentricity TNOs in the heavily populated 5:2 resonance are easily lost due to noisy migration. Improved observations of the low-eccentricity region of the 5:2 resonance and of weak mean motion resonances with Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide better population estimates, allowing for comparison with our model's retention fractions and providing strong evidence for or against Neptune's random interactions with planetesimals.",39 au75 auanalytic modelmean motion resonancenoisy migrationOuter Solar System Origins Surveyplanetesimal diskplanetesimalspopulation estimaterandom walkresonance retentionTrans Neptunian Objectsweak mean motion resonances

A decade of high-throughput sequencing-based investigations into the genomic basis of migration points to an integrative framework that incorporates quantitative genetics, evolutionary developmental biology, phenotypic plasticity, and epigenetics to explain migration evolution. In this perspective, I argue that the transcontinental migration of the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus) can serve as a compelling system to study the mechanism of evolutionary lability of a complex trait. Monarchs show significant phenotypic and genotypic diversity across their global range, with phenotypic switching that allows for explicit study of evolutionary lability. A developmental approach for elucidating how migratory traits are generated and functionally integrated will be important for understanding the evolution of monarch migration traits. I propose a plasticity threshold model to describe migration lability, and I describe novel functional techniques that will help resolve open questions and model assumptions.

The type of architecture that evolves depends strongly on the migration rate, as weakly selected loci experience swamping and do not make lasting contributions to divergence. Simulations from previous studies showed that even when mutations are strongly selected and should resist migration swamping, the architecture of adaptation can collapse and become transient at high mutation rates. Here, we use an analytical two-population model to study how this transition in genetic architecture depends upon population size, strength of selection, and parameters describing the mutation process. To do this, we develop a mathematical theory based on the diffusion approximation to predict the threshold mutation rate above which the transition occurs. We find that this performs well across a wide range of parameter space, based on comparisons with individual-based simulations. The threshold mutation rate depends most strongly on the average effect size of mutations, weakly on the strength of selection, and marginally on the population size. Across a wide range of the parameter space, we observe that the transition to a transient architecture occurs when the trait-wide mutation rate is 10(-3)-10(-2), suggesting that this phenomenon is potentially relevant to complex traits with a large mutational target. On the other hand, based on the apparent stability of genetic architecture in many classic examples of local adaptation, our theory suggests that per-trait mutation rates are often relatively low.",Author Keywordslocal adaptationpolygenic traitpopulation geneticsdiffusion theoryKeywords PlusSTABILIZING SELECTIONQUANTITATIVE TRAITSGENE FLOWESTABLISHMENTDIVERGENCEEVOLUTIONMAINTENANCEPOPULATIONSPROBABILITYBALANCE

When environments are fixed and there is one most favorable site, migration to other sites lowers overall growth rate and is not favored. Here we ask, can environmental variability favor migration when there is one best site on average? Previous work suggests that the answer is yes, but a general and precise answer remained elusive. Here we establish new, rigorous inequalities to show (and use simulations to illustrate) how stochastic growth rate can increase with migration when fitness (dis)advantages fluctuate over time across sites. The effect of migration between sites on the overall stochastic growth rate depends on the difference in expected growth rates and the variance of the fluctuating difference in growth rates. When fluctuations (variance) are large, a population can benefit from bursts of higher growth in sites that are worse on average. Such bursts become more probable as the between-site variance increases. Our results apply to many ( >= 2) sites, and reveal an interplay between the length of paths between sites, the average differences in site-specific growth rates, and the size of fluctuations.

Examples of population systems with stable divergence of the genetic structures of subpopulations inhabiting a homogeneous range occur in nature and experimental systems. Comparison of these observations and the results of modeling allow us to explain the persisting stability of natural genetic divergence by the mechanism of interaction between disruptive selection (in the form of the reduced fitness of hybrid forms) and a weak migration process. This is supported by the results of experiments performed by Yu.P. Altukhov et al. on box populations of Drosophila melanogaster, in which the primary divergence of the subpopulation genetic structures at the alpha-GDH locus was achieved. We can assume that disruptive selection, in this case, the reduced fitness of alpha-GDH heterozygotes, played a significant role in maintaining this divergence. An alternative hypothesis suggests the differences were fixed as a result of genetic drift. On the one hand, to identify and substantiate the possibility of this factor being present in a given system, and, on the other hand, to assess the significance of the disruptive selection for maintaining the stability of primary genetic divergence, we analyze mathematical models of the dynamics of allele frequencies in a large panmictic population and in a system of 30 local migration-coupled populations.

To address these concerns, we developed a stage-based population model to explore: (1) influences of passage over structures, (2) rearing habitats upstream of the structures, and (3) consequences of additional barriers to passage in the system. Model simulations suggest high fish passage at the ladders was associated with the highest smolt and adult abundance of coho salmon. The importance of passage was strongly influenced by juveniles rearing in a lake, where increased lake rearing at each passage scenario increased abundance of smolts and adults. Opening habitat further upstream was estimated to increase adult and smolt abundance up to 12%. Results of model simulations also helped to identify uncertainties that could be evaluated further (e.g., juvenile rearing in the lake). In general, our findings point to the importance of considering a full range of processes that can drive expected outcomes for assisted migration.",Author Keywordsdemographic modelfish laddersOncorhynchus kisutchupstream migrationKeywords PlusONCORHYNCHUS-KISUTCHSURVIVALSIZEGROWTHSTREAMCOLONIZATIONMORTALITYMOVEMENTSUCCESSFISHES

The industrial structure then changes the age structure of the local labour force via the migrations of young workers as non-agricultural sectors expand.

However, directly observing the dispersal mechanisms of widespread species can be costly or even impractical, which is the case for mangrove trees. The influence of ocean currents on mangrove dispersal is increasingly evident; however, few studies mechanistically relate the patterns of population distribution with the dispersal by oceanic currents under an integrated framework. Here, we evaluate the role of oceanic currents on connectivity of Rhizophora mangle along the Southwest Atlantic. We inferred population genetic structure and migration rates, simulated the displacement of propagules and tested our hypotheses with Mantel tests and redundancy analysis. We observed populations structured in two major groups, north and south, which is corroborated by other studies with Rhizophora and other coastal plants. Inferred recent migration rates do not indicate ongoing gene flow between sites. Conversely, long-term migration rates were low across groups and contrasting dispersal patterns within each one, which is consistent with long-distance dispersal events. Our hypothesis tests suggest that both isolation by distance and isolation by oceanography (derived from the oceanic currents) can explain the neutral genetic variation of R. mangle in the region. Our findings expand current knowledge of mangrove connectivity and highlight how the association of molecular methods with oceanographic simulations improve the interpretation of the dispersal process.

[Methods] An automatic searchlight trap was used to systematically monitor the movements and population dynamics of S. frugipeda in southern Yunnan in 2020. We inferred the source population based on trapping data, and by integrating meteorological data with insect flight trajectory simulation. [Results] S. frugipeda moths were caught all year round, and there were multiple monthly peaks of abundance from March to April and June to October. The population dynamics of S. frugipeda in this region is complex, with populations comprised of varying proportions of local and migrating individuals in different seasons. From January to February, most moths were of local origin and are unable to migrate northward due to low temperatures. From March to April, captures consisted of a mix of locally bred and immigrant moths, with emigrating moths that reach Guizhou and Guangxi primarily originating from southeastern Myanmar. From May to July, a higher proportion of moths were captured in the latter half of the night in Jiangcheng, indicating immigration from outside China, whereas in Yuanjiang, most moths were captured in the first half of the night, indicating continuous northward migration. From August to October, the proportion of moths captured throughout the night stabilized, indicating a mixture of local and immigrant moths. Most immigrants came from locations within China such as Guizhou and Sichuan. Local moths are capable of migrating to other countries such as Myanmar. [Conclusion] These results provide sights into the population dynamics and migratory behavior of S. frugipeda in southern Yunnan, and also elucidate the immigration, emigration, and atmospheric factors that influence the migration of this species.

Row_79,"Turnock, Megan F.",Conservation Genetics and Population Viability Analysis of the Selkirk and Cabinet-Yaak Grizzly Bear Populations,University of Idaho,2024,0,"Population fragmentation affects numerous species throughout the world by reducing large, continuous populations into small remnant populations separated by barriers or unsuitable habitat. Small, fragmented populations face elevated risks of extinction and lose genetic diversity more quickly than larger populations. However, genetic diversity may be maintained if migration occurs between fragmented populations. Although fragmentation affects many species, large carnivores are particularly susceptible to fragmentation due to their large home ranges and potential for negative interactions with humans. Grizzly bears ( Ursus arctos ) in North America are one such example. In the lower 48 United States (U.S.), this species was reduced from a contiguous population across the western U.S. to five fragmented populations occupying just 2% of the species’ former range. The smallest of these populations are the Selkirk, Yaak, and Cabinet populations of Montana, Idaho, Washington, and British Columbia. These populations of approximately 100 bears or fewer were isolated for generations, but they have recently been experiencing increased gene flow due to natural connectivity and a population augmentation program. Due to the small size of these populations, they are reliant on connectivity to maintain genetic diversity, but the specific levels of migration and augmentation needed are not well understood. Long-term genetic sampling conducted in these populations presented a unique opportunity to evaluate trends in genetic diversity over approximately five bear generations, then model future genetic diversity and population growth rates under varying levels of migration and augmentation. In Chapter 1, we tested the hypothesis that genetic diversity increased as a result of gene flow into the Selkirk, Yaak, and Cabinet populations. We also estimated effective population size, an important parameter that determines how quickly a population will lose diversity due to genetic drift. Post gene flow, allelic richness increased in the Selkirk and Cabinet populations and pairwise relatedness decreased in all three populations, while heterozygosity did not significantly change in any population. Effective population size was 15.2-15.8, 15.4-17.5, and 5.6-8.9 for the Selkirk, Yaak, and Cabinet populations, respectively. Despite small effective population sizes, current levels of gene flow and augmentation appear to be maintaining or increasing genetic diversity in these populations. In Chapter 2, we used population viability analysis to model the effect of different migration and augmentation rates on genetic diversity and population growth rates in the Selkirk, Yaak, and Cabinet populations 100 years into the future. We found that genetic diversity was likely to increase and growth rates remained positive under baseline conditions in all three populations. Genetic diversity declined over the 100-year simulation period in the Selkirk and Yaak populations when migration rates were reduced below half of baseline rates, while population growth in the Yaak became negative when migration rates decreased below baseline. Population augmentation benefited genetic diversity and population growth in the Cabinet population, and we found that replacing augmentation with migration did not fully compensate for the loss of augmentation. Overall, our results demonstrate the beneficial impact of gene flow to small populations and provide a comprehensive genetic baseline for the Selkirk and Cabinet-Yaak grizzly bear populations that will be a useful comparison for future genetic monitoring.",

Row_87,"Chen, Jinghao",Mathematical Modeling of Collective Cell Migration in Wound Healing,"University of California, Irvine",2024,0,"The collective migration of keratinocytes during wound healing requires both the generation and transmission of mechanical forces for individual cellular locomotion and the coordination of movement across cells. Leader cells along the wound edge transmit mechanical and biochemical cues to ensuing follower cells, ensuring their coordinated direction of migration across multiple cells. Despite the observed importance of mechanical cues in leader cell formation and in controlling coordinated directionality of cell migration, the underlying biophysical mechanisms remain elusive. The mechanically-activated ion channel PIEZO1 was recently identified to play an inhibitory role during the reepithelialization of wounds. Here, through an integrative experimental and mathematical modeling approach, we elucidate PIEZO1’s contributions to collective migration. Time-lapse microscopy reveals that PIEZO1 activity inhibits leader cell formation at the wound edge. To probe the relationship between PIEZO1 activity, leader cell formation and inhibition of reepithelialization, we developed an integrative 2D continuum model of wound closure that links observations at the single cell and collective cell migration scales. Through numerical simulations and subsequent experimental validation, we found that coordinated directionality plays a key role during wound closure and is inhibited by upregulated PIEZO1 activity. We propose that PIEZO1-mediated retraction suppresses leader cell formation which inhibits coordinated directionality between cells during collective migration. We also extended the model to include two distinct cell types, each governed by its own set of equations and parameters, interacting through cell-cell adhesion, volume-filling effects, and wound edge retraction. Simulations with various cell mixtures reveal that mutually repulsive cells promote wound closure more effectively than homogeneous populations, with the promotion level amplified by mixture heterogeneity. Additionally, simulations show that cells with higher PIEZO1 activity are generally less represented among edge cells, correlating with wound edge retraction. Through the study of this extended model, we comprehensively explored the roles of cell-cell interactions and heterogeneity in collective cell migration involving PIEZO1 mixtures.",

Consequently, the migration pattern from the pre-fishing distribution to fishing grounds may be changing. This study investigated inter-annual variations in westward spawning migration parameters using a migration model. Case studies were conducted to estimate optimal values for the initiation date of spawning migration and migration speed during spawning migration. The estimated optimal initiation date of spawning migration from 2003 to 2018 was July 13 to August 8, with an average of July 31. However, in 2019 and 2020, the initiation date of spawning migration was August 22 and September 5, respectively, significantly later than that in 2003-2018 (p < .01). The estimated optimal swimming speed during spawning migration in 2019 and 2020 was not significantly different from that in 2003-2018 (p > .7). These results indicate that delays in the initiation of spawning migration occurred in 2019 and 2020, leading to an eastward shift of fishing grounds. The mean body weight of the age-1 Pacific saury in the pre-fishing season had a significant negative correlation (p < .01) with the initiation date of spawning migration. This result suggests that Pacific saury with low body weight continues to feed for growth instead of initiating spawning migration. However, body weight at initiation of spawning migration had a significant decreasing trend (p < .01), indicating that the Pacific saury had to start spawning migration despite low body weight in recent years.",Author Keywordsfishing groundFRA-ROMSmigration characteristicsmigration modelPacific sauryspawning migrationVASTKeywords PlusNORTHWESTERN PACIFICOYASHIO REGIONWESTERNSCOMBERESOCIDAECOPEPODAOTOLITH

It is relevant to fundamental biological processes like bacterial chemotaxis, development, disease progression, etc. So, understanding migration is pivotal to addressing fundamental questions in biology. We address three broad questions relevant to cell migration using models from physics: (i) What are the critical features of cancer cell migration? (ii) Is it possible to explain complex cell migration data using minimal biochemical networks? And (iii) how does cell-to-cell communication affect its migration at the population level? To address these questions we performed (i) mathematical analysis using the Cellular Potts model, simulations using the Biased Persistent random walk model, and steady-state analysis of cell response to graded signals to explain cancer cell migration in response to single and multiple chemical and mechanical signals, (ii) rigorous network analysis of ∼ 500,000 minimal networks having features of fundamental biochemical processes like regulation, conversion or molecular binding to understand the origin of antagonism in multiple cue cancer cell migration experiments and (iii) the steady-state analysis of KellerSegel equations mimicking collective cell migration to understand the role of cell to cell communication on chemotaxis of a bacterial population. From our analysis, we found that (i) persistence and bias in cancer cell migration are decoupled from each other owing to a lack of memory about past movements and for any general cell migration they are inherently constrained to take only a fixed set of values. (ii) Bias in cancer cell migration in response to a combination of chemoattractant gradients can be less than the response to individual gradients (antagonism in bias) while the speed remains unaltered. This antagonism in bias and lack thereof in speed can be explained by several minimal networks having molecular regulation, conversion, or binding as its central feature and all these distinct mechanisms show convergence and saturation of an internal molecule common to both the chemoattractants. (iii) By analyzing the role of cell-cell communication in bacterial chemotaxis using the Keller-Segel model we find that communication enhances chemotaxis only when it is adaptive to its external surroundings and cell-to-cell variability helps in increasing the chemotactic drift in the bacterial population.",

During migration, bird populations often disperse in groups and aggregate together due to geographical barriers, topography, seasonal climatic changes, species specific physiology, or other factors. Recording and reconstructing these diverse migratory routes are important for identifying major stopover sites as well as migration bottlenecks which may include key foraging grounds and resting areas, and ensuring high-quality habitat to provide adequate resources. However, good data including individual tracking data are only available for some regions and species large enough to carry a transmitter. Better approaches using observational data are needed to enable better understanding in less-studied regions. To reconstruct and visualize the long-distance avian migration routes with observations from the citizen-science dataset eBird, we developed an interpretive avian multi-trajectory reconstruction framework based on Level-order-Minimum-cost-Traversal (LoMcT) algorithm. This approach uses linear interpolation for missing records, spatial outlier detection for abnormal values, unsupervised clustering by density-based Mean-Shift algorithm for sub-group centroids, LoMcT algorithm based on the distances among centroids, and multi-trajectory reconstruction based on generalized additive models. We have verified the feasibility of our reconstruction method using 15 bird species, and analyzed the trends of the distribution density of birds' population during the long-distance migration cycle. Our analysis could help obtain the important gathering time points and sites in the moving process based on the multiple routes we reconstructed. These can be used in comparisons of multi-trajectory migration strategies between the transoceanic migratory birds and non-transoceanic ones, and provide the ability to understand how species are moving in the absence of individual tracking data to help target conservation better.

Kyiv National Economic University named after Vadym Hetman, Kyiv, 2021. The dissertation is devoted to the study of migration processes, their intensification, and the development of a set of economic and mathematical dynamic models of migration flows and their impact on socio-economic stability. Due to the high level of shadowing of Ukraine's economy, and the lack of adequate data on the level of external and internal migration, the need to use modern methods of economic and mathematical modeling to find the interdependence of migration flows on socioeconomic stability was justified. The analysis of economic-mathematical models and methods of regulation of migration flows and the labor market allowed to substantiate the need to develop a modern set of econometric and simulation macro models to achieve the goals of the dissertation research. Based on the analysis, the expediency of developing an author's complex of interdependent economic and mathematical macroeconomic models of vector autoregression and a separate set of models of system dynamics was substantiated. The concept of migration and the migrant was systematized, the prospects of intensification of migration flow in connection with the spread of globalization were considered, and their formation was studied taking into account the high level of shadowing of the economy, which is typical for Ukraine. It was found that globalization can have both positive and negative effects on the intensification of migration flows, which is manifested in the presence or absence of integration of countries into world production and technological chains. Based on the statistical and economic analysis, the key economic factors influencing migration processes in Ukraine were identified, as well as the impact of intensification of migration flows on the sex and age structure of the population was determined. Relevant hypotheses and assumptions about the intensification of migration flows and their potential impact on socio-economic stability indicators were formed. In particular, the analysis revealed that the main factor contributing to the increase of migration processes is wages, as its level in Ukraine is 5-20 times lower than the average wage in Europe and America. In this case, the deterrent to external migration is the existence of shadow schemes for the payment of wages in envelopes, as well as the existence of other schemes of tax evasion. It was determined that the increase in the intensification of migration processes leads to an increase in the number of remittances of migrants to Ukraine. Based on the economic and mathematical analysis, a set of macroeconomic economic, and mathematical models of system dynamics and dynamic vector autoregressive model was developed and built, which allowed to determine endogenous quantitative relationships between migration levels and key factors determining the socio-economic state of the country. Based on the constructed econometric vector autoregressive model, it was found that the most important factor in the formation of a negative emigration balance is a sharp increase in unemployment in Ukraine, which refutes the common opinion about the most important factor influencing wages on migration in Ukraine. Also, it was found that with the increase of remittances to Ukraine, the level of emigration decreases, which can be explained by the fact that the economic condition of households of migrant origin is improving. These results were obtained based on the analysis of the impulse response functions of the constructed VAR-model. Also, the functions of impulse responses to the impact of migration processes on socio-economic stability through indicators of remittances, GDP, wages, and unemployment were built. Based on the results obtained in the VAR-model, as well as based on existing theories of migration, a set of interconnected and complementary macroeconomic simulation submodels was built by the method of system dynamics of migration intensification. During the simulation, the annual value of the net migration flow in Ukraine was calculated using a method called the aging chain. This method allowed us to determine the annual change in external migration, and to make assumptions about the growth or reduction of migration in the long run. The general model of system dynamics consists of 7 interrelated submodels, namely population distribution, wage formation, shadow wage component formation, labor market model, migration flows, remittances, and general macroeconomic model. They can be used both in combination and separately, depending on the purposes of modeling. The formation of the shadow wage model includes an additional model of the tax evasion scheme through the creation of fictitious entrepreneurs, which helps to identify the potential risks of such a scheme for socio-economic stability. The general macroeconomic submodel combines the results of labor market modeling and population formation. The key idea of this submodel is to develop productivity formation based on data on the number of employees in the research and development sector, as well as the use of modern production technologies. The simulation of this submodel determines the need to stimulate research in the field of development to increase productivity and ensure economic growth. Based on modeling by methods of system dynamics and assessment of gender and age structure of the population, it was determined that migration in recent years in Ukraine is declining, but the population younger than working age is declining every year. The study found that migration, in general, has a positive impact on the economy of Ukraine due to the increase in the number of remittances of migrants, but it should be noted that due to changes in the sex and age structure of the population, migration will harm the economy. Therefore, it is necessary to develop and implement an effective policy of labor market regulation and migration processes to ensure socioeconomic stability. Based on the set of models of system dynamics, scenario analysis of the formation of migration flows was conducted, which assessed the change in the intensification of migration processes depending on changes in wages and unemployment, analysis of cash flows of migrants, and estimated gross domestic product losses from migration. According to the results of the scenario analysis based on the built set of simulation models by the methods of system dynamics, it was found that emigration has a positive effect on reducing unemployment, increasing the number of wages and remittances. At the same time, the most effective policy for reducing the number of migrants is the simultaneous implementation of measures to increase wages and reduce unemployment in Ukraine. Based on the simulation results, recommendations were developed for several measures to regulate migration processes, which should be carried out through labor market regulation, as restraining emigration in the context of the existence of socioeconomic stability is impractical. Therefore, the government should pay attention to reforming the State Employment Service and ensuring the effective functioning of the labor market, which will be accompanied by increased social guarantees for the working population, increased wages, and employment incentives, including by reducing the shadow share of wages. Such measures are necessary given the significant shadowing of the economy in Ukraine and the existence of economic instability. Thus, the existence of migration processes in Ukraine is a factor in ensuring socio-economic stability, but they are an indicator of the need to develop effective policies to regulate the labor market to ensure it, reduce the shadow economy and ensure sustainable economic growth in Ukraine. Based on the results, the concepts of migration and migrant, socio-economic stability are summarized, key factors influencing the formation of migration processes are identified, short-term and long-term effects of intensification of migration flows on the economy are assessed, and a wide range of scenario analysis is conducted. policies to regulate the labor market and migration flows in the context of significant shadowing of the economy to achieve socio-economic stability in the long run.",

For this purpose, the MOCCA code has been significantly extended to take into account the formation of an enriched population of stars from re-accreted gas with a time delay after the formation of the pristine population of stars. The possibility of cluster migration in the host galaxy and the fact that the pristine population can be described by a model, not in virial equilibrium are also taken into account. Gas re-accretion and cluster migration have a decisive impact on the observational parameters of clusters and the ratio of the number of objects between the pristine and enriched populations. The obtained results, together with observational data, suggest a speculative scenario that makes it possible to explain observational data, the correlation between the mass of the cluster and the ratio of the pristine to the enriched populations, and the observational fact that for some globular clusters, the pristine population is more concentrated than the enriched one. In this scenario, it is important to take into account the environment in which the cluster lives, the conditions in the galaxy when it formed, and the fact that a significant part of the globular clusters associated with the Galaxy come from dwarf galaxies that merged with the Milky Way. The initial conditions describing GCs in the simulations discussed in the paper are different from typical initial GC models that are widely used. Instead of GCs being highly concentrated and lying deep inside the Roche lobe, models that fill the Roche lobe are required. This carries strong constraints on where in the galaxy GCs are formed.",

Gene flow between sub-populations is a potent mechanism to provide such variation and can hence facilitate adaptation, for instance by increasing genetic variation or via the introduction of beneficial variants. On the other hand, if gene flow between different habitats is too strong, locally beneficial alleles may not be able to establish permanently. In the context of evolutionary rescue, intermediate levels of gene flow are therefore often optimal for maximizing a species chance for survival in metapopulations without spatial structure. To which extent and under which conditions gene flow facilitates or hinders evolutionary rescue in spatially structured populations remains unresolved. We address this question by studying the differences between evolutionary rescue in the island model and in the stepping stone model in a gradually deteriorating habitat. We show that evolutionary rescue is modulated by the rate of gene flow between different habitats, which in turn depends strongly on the spatial structure and the pattern of environmental deterioration. We use these insights to show that in many cases spatially structured models can be translated into a simpler island model using an appropriately scaled effective migration rate.",Keywords PlusANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCELOCAL ADAPTATIONRAPID EVOLUTIONPOPULATIONSIMMIGRATIONEXTINCTIONDISPERSALPROBABILITYGENETICSDENSITY

Intensive studies have revealed that it may provide an effective mechanism to promote cooperation in the context of spatial prisoner' dilemma. As an attempt to give a more generic analysis on how migration influences the evolution of cooperation, we in this work propose a dynamic model that takes into account the agents' different tendencies on migration and imitation. More importantly, we introduce two in-formation accuracy parameters that respectively affect the agents' decisions on the migration destination and on their imitation in the current neighborhood. The simulation results show that the higher accuracy of the information on imitation and migration contributes to a higher cooperation level. In particular, the imitation-oriented mode is more conducive to cooperation when the imitation information accuracy is high. Likewise, the migration-oriented mode is more conducive to cooperation with higher accuracy of the migration infor-mation. When imitation and migration information accuracies are both high, cooperation is effectively maintained in two different ways: the imitation-dominant pattern and the migration-dominant pattern, while the scenario in which the imitation tendency is close to the migration tendency has an inhibitory effect on cooperation. Finally, we analyse the robustness of the results under different population densities.",Author KeywordsEvolution of cooperationPrisoner's dilemmaMigrationInformation accuracyKeywords PlusDRIVENGAMESTRATEGY

This model incorporates a transition zone exterior to the inner truncation of the disk, where the surface density profile is modified by the diffusion of the stellar magnetic field into the disk. This modification results in a migration trap at the outer edge of the transition zone. We first performed simulations of single planet migration, considering a range of stellar magnetic field strengths and magnetic diffusion profiles. Our simulations show a tight relationship between the final locations of planets and the total magnetic budget available for the disk from their host star.

In particular, when a migrant population finds favorable conditions in a region, it can settle there permanently. Since biological invasions represent a serious threat to biodiversity, we are interested in determining if and when a marginal contact of a moving population with a territory occupied by other populations is sufficient to trigger an invasion mechanism. The interaction problem of a migrant population with a residential one is considered, where the contact occurs just on the boundary of the region occupied by the native population. To study whether and how the migrants induce changes in the ecosystem subject to their transit, two models are considered. The former accounts only for damage on the native species, with no gain for the migrant population. In the second one, migrants are assumed to be predators and therefore gaining an advantage for survivability. The comparison of the two models' behaviors gives insights on the invasion process. The theoretical analysis of the two models is complemented by numerical simulations. The models suggest that, even without a direct benefit for the migratory population, these kinds of interactions can have serious ecological consequences for the native population that can even lead to its extinction. Comparing the results, it is instead found that if the migrating species is a predator, even this very reduced interaction on the boundary is enough to trigger invasion and migrants permanently settle in the territory.",Author KeywordsPeriodic migrationMigratory disturbanceMigrating predatorResidential preyMarginal interactionsBorder fractional dimensionFractal boundary geometryBiological invasionBistabilitybSTABKeywords PlusBEHAVIORAL ECOLOGYSTRATEGIESMANAGEMENTSQUIRRELSRED

Monarch butterflies are a vagile species with an open-population structure. Selecting locations for monarch butterfly- breeding habitat restoration that aligns with natural movement behavior will facilitate efficient habitat utilization across the landscape, increase realized fecundity, and ultimately support increases in the overwintering population size in Mexico. Obtaining and interpreting empirical movement and space-use data through field and laboratory studies are fundamental to this effort. To gain insights into population responses at larger, spatially explicit landscape scales, the results from empirical studies can be incorporated into simulation models.

[1]",Migration and tolerance shape host behaviour and response to parasite infection,JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY,OCT 2021,2,"Numerous theoretical models have demonstrated that migration, a seasonal animal movement behaviour, can minimize the risks and costs of parasite infection. Past work on migration-infection interactions assumes migration is the only strategy available to organisms for dealing with the parasite infection, that is they migrate to a different environment to recover or escape from infection. Thus, migration is similar to the non-spatial strategy of resistance, where hosts prevent infection or kill parasites once infected. However, an alternative defence strategy is to tolerate the infection and experience a lower cost to the infection. To our knowledge, no studies have examined how migration can change based on combining two host strategies (migration and tolerance) for dealing with parasites. In this paper, we aim to understand how both parasite transmission and infection tolerance can influence the host's migratory behaviour. We constructed a model that incorporates two host strategies (migration and tolerance) to understand whether allowing for tolerance affects the proportion of the population that migrates at equilibrium in response to infection. We show that the benefits of tolerance can either decrease or increase the host's migration. Also, if the benefit of migration is great, then individuals are more likely to migrate regardless of the presence of tolerance. Finally, we find that the transmission rate of parasite infection can either decrease or increase the tolerant host's migration, depending on the cost of migration. These findings highlight that adopting two defence strategies is not always beneficial to the hosts. Instead, a single strategy is often better, depending on the costs and benefits of the strategies and infection pressures. Our work further suggests that multiple host-defence strategies as a potential explanation for the evolution of migration to minimize the parasite infection. Moreover, migration can also affect the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of parasite-host interactions.",Author Keywordshost-parasite interactionpartial migrationtoleranceresistancepopulation dynamicsKeywords PlusPATHOGEN TRANSMISSIONECOLOGICAL FEEDBACKSRESISTANCEEVOLUTIONDEFENSEAVOIDANCEVIRULENCE

Aims Bird ringing data usually cover long periods and might reflect long-term population changes. However, they are mainly derived during non-standardized multi-species catching at numerous sites during the autumn migration period. We searched for the best modelling approach to determine reliable species population dynamics and trend estimation models based on annual multi-species bird ringing data. Methods We used ringing data from the Slovenian Bird Ringing Scheme and selected data in three steps according to temporal, quantitative, and qualitative data selection. Annual indices were constructed based on two types of denominators, ringing days, and ringing totals, vs. a robust model without a denominator. We ran 20 candidate-generalized additive models describing migrating population dynamics for 15 bird species by combining different data selection approaches and denominators. Results We found that the models were species-specific, although the universal model could also be applied to most species. We propose a general model construction approach for population trend assessments from non-standardized bird ringing data. The estimates obtained by this approach were comparable to the overall European population trends derived from breeding survey data. Conclusions Bird ringing data from the autumn migration period are a valuable resource for assessing continental scale population trends taking into account the whole population (non-breeders and juveniles included) and even some rare and endangered species, but should be conducted according to standard protocols to ensure reliable statistical inference of population trends.",Keywords PlusTOTALS

Although long-distance migration is well documented in China, patterns of transboundary migration among China, Russia and Mongolia are largely unknown. We performed a phase analysis of L. sticticalis periodic outbreaks among three countries based on 30 years of historical population data, analyzed the wind systems during migration over boundary regions, and traced the migratory routes in a case study of outbreaks in 2008 by trajectory simulation. RESULTS: Highly synchronized outbreak years of L. sticticalis were observed between China and Mongolia, China and eastern Siberia, China and western Siberia, Mongolia and eastern Siberia, eastern Siberia and western Siberia from 1978 to 2008, indicating possible transboundary migration between these regions. Winds at 300-600 m altitude, where adult migration usually occurs, also showed a high probability of northwestern winds in Haila'er (China), Chita (Russia) and Choybalsan (Mongolia), favoring successful adult migration from these areas to northern and northeastern China. Back trajectory analysis further showed that the first-generation adults that caused the severe outbreak of second-generation larvae in 2008 originated from eastern Siberia, eastern Mongolia, and the boundary regions of China-Russia and China-Mongolia. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrated that the source of L. sticticalis outbreaks in northern China was closely related to the outbreaks in Siberia and Mongolia via long-distance transboundary windborne migration.

The models?random forest, extra trees, and gradient boosting regressor?were successfully applied to three full-scale WWTPs in Shenzhen, China. All the models demonstrated robust performance in predicting influent flow rate, ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N), and total nitrogen (TN). Feature importance analysis revealed that the average precipitation over the past n days and population migration were the most influential factors for predicting influent flow rate. Conversely, human activities have a greater impact on pollutant concentrations. Scenario analyses indicated that precipitation contributed to approximately 5%-10% of the wastewater influent, while groundwater infiltration accounted for around 20%.

A few cases of parallel local adaptation were reported in plants but underlying mechanisms promoting or preventing the parallel response, such as the balance between migration and selection, were rarely quantified. Here, we conducted a transplant experiment to test whether distinct foothill-alpine population pairs of Arabidopsis arenosa exhibited similar adaptive responses to a contrasting alpine environment. We further investigated selection and migration patterns in these populations. Seedlings of 16 foothill and alpine populations of A. arenosa from four distinct mountain regions (one occupied by diploid and three by tetraploid populations) were transplanted into one low- and one high-elevation site. We recorded fitness proxies over two growing seasons to test whether the elevation-of-origin advantage was manifested in the same way across the four regions of origin. Then, we quantified the strength of selection on the traits at each transplantation site and used coalescent simulations to estimate past gene flow intensity between each pair of foothill and alpine populations in each region. We demonstrated that the four pairs of populations exhibited similar adaptive responses to elevation difference in terms of survival, number of flowering plants, stem height and accumulation of above-ground dry biomass; the other traits (rosette size, number of leaves, stems and flowers) exhibited rather regional-specific patterns. In addition, we found minor effects of ploidy level on the fitness proxies recorded. Our selection and migration analysis revealed that parallel local adaptation was probably achieved by differential selective pressure at low versus high elevation in combination with lack or limited gene flow between foothill and alpine populations. Synthesis. We show that the previously documented strong morphological and genetic distinctness of alpine A. arenosa compared to their foothill counterparts, which has been hypothesized to be driven by natural selection, is indeed mirrored in fitness differences consistent with parallel local adaptation.

In the summer of 2020, we were tasked with a COVID-19 pandemic response project to create a detailed behavioral simulation model of the entire campus population at Binghamton University. We conceptualized this problem as an agent migration process on a multilayer transportation network, in which each layer represented a different transportation mode. As no direct data were available about people's behaviors on campus, we collected as much indirect information as possible to inform the agents' behavioral rules. Each agent was assumed to move along the shortest path between two locations within each transportation layer and switch layers at a parking lot or a bus stop, along with several other behavioral assumptions. Using this model, we conducted simulations of the whole campus population behaviors on a typical weekday, involving more than 25,000 agents. We measured the frequency of close social contacts at each spatial location and identified several busy locations and corridors on campus that needed substantial behavioral intervention. Moreover, systematic simulations with varying population density revealed that the effect of population density reduction was nonlinear, and that reducing the population density to 40-45% would be optimal and sufficient to suppress disease spreading on campus.

This appears to be in contrast with constraints on the stellar populations of the Milky Way, suggesting that the bulk of the Galactic thin disc formed after $z=1$, and raises questions about the history, evolution, and survivability of primordial discs. Here, we use GigaEris, a state-of-the-art $N$-body, hydrodynamical, cosmological ``zoom-in'' simulation with a billion particles within the virial radius, to delve into the formation of the early kinematically cold discs (KCDs), defined by their ratio between the mean rotational velocity and the radial velocity dispersion, of a Milky Way-sized galaxy at redshifts $z\gtrsim 4$. Our analysis reveals a primarily inward migration pattern for disc stars formed at $z \gtrsim 6$, turning into a mix of inward and outward migration at later times. Stars migrating outwards undergo minimal kinematic heating, and might be identified as part of the thin disc forming at much later epochs. We find that approximately 76 per cent of all stars formed in the KCD at $z \sim 7$ become part of a pseudo-bulge by $z = 4.4$. This proportion decreases to below 10 per cent for KCD stars formed at $z \lesssim 5$. The inward migration of stars born in our KCDs at $z \gtrsim 4$ deviates from the expected inside-out formation scenario of thin discs at lower redshifts.

Environmental stress is measured using historical cyclone impacts, salinization, and land loss from erosion. Household migration decisions are based on current and expected future income streams in different locations. Rising environmental damage raises costs, but it may also induce increased public assistance that moderates or neutralizes those costs, diminishing migration incentives, even in areas hard-hit by climate change. Econometric estimates for the Sundarbans region shared by India and Bangladesh suggest that endogenous public assistance strongly dampens the migration response to rising environmental stress in both countries, though the assistance response and migration dampening are lower in Bangladesh. A broader analysis for the coastal region from India's Odisha State to eastern Bangladesh finds that present and past cyclone impacts are highly significant for explaining coastal population changes, although responses are lower in India because of lower environmental stress and greater public-assistance intensity. A counterfactual simulation suggests that, as a result of cyclones since 1970, the affected regions are 8-10% less populous in Bangladesh but only 2% less populous in India.

The prey population in the ecosystem can migrate from the reservation zone to the unreserved zone and vice versa, while the predator population is assumed to be looking for prey in the unreserved zone. The dynamics of predator and prey are expressed in the form of a system of differential equations based on food intake capacity and some other factors. In the interaction mechanism between the prey and the predator, the Holling type III predation response function is considered. The existence of an interior equilibrium point of the model is analyzed and investigated for its stability using the linearization method and the Routh-Hurwitz stability test. There is a certain condition where, with the appropriate parameter values, the interior equilibrium point exists and is stable. When the migration rate from the unreserved zone is gradually increased within a certain range of values, the equilibrium point also changes but remains stable. The prey and predator populations in an unreserved zone decrease while the prey population in the reservation zone increases.

To inform current management strategies and prevent further introduction of these species, it is necessary to gain insights into current population structure and migration history of these species. Additionally, as T. absoluta has yet to be detected in North America, effective molecular diagnostics are needed to improve quarantine and monitoring efforts.  In chapter one, we sequenced whole genomes of hundreds of D. suzukii samples collected worldwide. We identified two major population clusters in the United States and found that West coast D. suzukii populations originated from a combination of migration events from Hawaii and Asia. We saw no strong loss in genetic diversity in invasive populations relative to Asian populations, suggesting ongoing migration is alleviating any bottleneck effects. In chapter two, we sequenced dozens of whole genomes of T. absoluta across Latin America and Spain and found three populations in Latin America. Using population simulation approaches, we found that these populations diverged prior to human agriculture of tomatoes. Additionally, we detected signals of selective sweeps near genes relevant to insecticide resistance and metabolism. In chapter three, we developed two molecular diagnostics to distinguish T. absoluta from two morphologically similar species already present in the United States. The probebased quantitative PCR diagnostic can differentiate between T. absoluta , Phthorimaea operculella , and Keiferia lycopersicella using a thermocycler, while the RPA-Cas12a diagnostic can identity presence of T. absoluta in an isothermal reaction with minimal lab equipment requirements.

Here, we extend our analysis to 3D, refining our $e$-damping formula and studying how the inclination damping efficiency is also affected. We perform high resolution 3D locally isothermal hydrodynamical simulations of planets with varying masses embedded in disks with varying aspect ratios and viscosities. We extract the gap profile and orbital damping timescales for fixed eccentricities and inclinations up to the disk scale height. The limit in gap depths below which vortices appear, in the low-viscosity case, happens roughly at the transition between classical type-I and type-II migration regimes. The orbital damping timescales can be described by two linear trends with a break around gap depths $\sim80\%$ and with slopes and intercepts depending on the eccentricity and inclination. These trends are understood on physical grounds and are reproduced by simple fitting formulas whose error is within the typically uncertainty of type-I torque formulas. Thus, our recipes for the gap depth and orbital damping efficiencies yield a simple description for planet-disk interactions to use in N-body codes in the case of partial gap opening planets that is consistent with high-resolution 3D hydro-simulations.

Multiple ecological stresses such as long-term overfishing, drying-up of riverine inflows, and decreases in spawning habitat caused the naked carp population to decrease from 320,000 tons before the 1950s to only 3000 tons by the early 2000s. We used matrix projection population modeling to quantitatively simulate the dynamics of the naked carp population from the 1950s to the 2020s. Five versions of the matrix model were developed from the field and laboratory information that represented different population states (high but declining, low abundance, very low abundance, initial recovery, pristine). Equilibrium analysis was applied to density-independent versions of the matrices and population growth rate, age composition, and elasticities were compared among versions. Stochastic, density-dependent version of the most recent decade (recovering) version was used to simulate the time-dependent responses to a range of levels of artificial repro-duction (addition of age-1 from hatchery) and of the pristine version to simulate combinations of fishing rate and minimum age of harvest. Results showed the major role of overfishing in the population decline and that the population growth rate was most sensitive to the survival of juveniles and the spawning success of early-age adults. Dynamic simulations showed a rapid population response to artificial reproduction when population abundance was low and that if artificial reproduction continues at its current level, then population biomass would reach 75% of its pristine biomass after 50 years. Simulations with the pristine version identified sus-tainable fishing levels and the importance of protecting the first few ages of maturity.

Further effectiveness should consider maximizing survival in the months just after release and maintaining genetic and phenotypic diversity.

In early Solar System numerical simulations, where chaos is a primary driver, it is difficult to explore parameter space in a systematic way. In such simulations, stable configurations are hard to come by, and often require special fine-tuning. In addition, it is infeasible to run suites of well-resolved, realistic simulations with massive particles to drive planetary evolution where enough particles remain to represent the transneptunian populations to robustly statistically compare with observations. To complement state of the art full N-body simulations, we develop a method to artificially control each planet's orbital elements independently from each other, which when carefully applied, can be used to test a wider suite of models. We modify two widely used publicly available N-body integrators: (1) the C code, REBOUND and (2) the FORTRAN code, Mercury. We show how the application of specific fictitious forces within numerical integrators can be used to tightly control planetary evolution to more easily explore migration and orbital excitation and damping. This tool allows us to replicate the impact a massive planetesimal disk would have on the planets, without actually including the massive planetesimals, thus decreasing the chaos and simulation runtime.

Moreover, the insufficient understanding of the anionic redox involved cation migration makes the design strategies of high energy density electrodes even less effective. Herein, a P3-Na0.67Li0.2Fe0.2Mn0.6O2 (P3-NLFM) cathode is proposed with the in-plane disordered Li distribution after an in-depth remolding of the Li ribbon-ordered P3-Na0.6Li0.2Mn0.8O2 (P3-NLM) layered oxide. The disordered Li sublattice in the transition metal slab of P3-NLFM leads to the dispersed |O-2p orbitals, the lowered charge transfer gap, and the suppressed phase transition at high voltages. Then the enhanced Mn-O interaction and electronic stability are disclosed by the crystal orbital Hamilton population (COHP) analysis at high voltage in P3-NLFM. Furthermore, ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulation suggests the order/disorder of the transition metal layer is highly correlated with the stability of the Li sublattice. The cross-layer migration and loss of Li in P3-NLM are suppressed in P3-NLFM to enable the high reversibility upon cycling. As a result, the P3-NLFM delivers a high capacity of 163 mAh g(-1) without oxygen release and an enhanced capacity retention of 81.9% (vs 42.9% in P3-NLM) after 200 cycles, which constitutes a promising approach for sustainable oxygen redox in rechargeable batteries.",Author KeywordsP3-Na0.67Li0.2Fe0.2Mn0.6O2anionic redoxstructural ordering/disorderingLi migrationsodium-ion batteriesKeywords PlusRAY-ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPYTOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONSVOLTAGE HYSTERESISION BATTERIESOXYGENVISUALIZATIONOXIDATIONCRYSTALSPECTRABULK

With the increasing availability of empirical datasets, emergent patterns can be inferred from communities by synthesizing how barriers filter and structure populations across species. We assemble phylogeographic data across a barrier and perform spatially explicit simulations, quantifying spatiotemporal patterns of divergence, the influence of traits on these patterns, and the statistical power needed to differentiate diversification modes.Taxon Vertebrates, Invertebrates, PlantsLocation North AmericaMethods We incorporate published datasets, from papers that match relevant keywords, to examine taxa around the Cochise Filter Barrier, separating the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts of North America, to synthesize phylogeographic structuring across the communities with respect to organismal functional traits. We then use simulation and machine learning to assess the power of phylogeographic model selection.Results Taxa distributed across the Cochise Filter Barrier show heterogeneous responses to the barrier in levels of gene flow, phylogeographic structure, divergence timing, barrier width, and divergence mechanism. These responses correlate with locomotor and thermoregulatory traits. Many taxa show a Pleistocene population genetic break, often with introgression after divergence. Allopatric isolation and isolation by environment are the primary mechanisms structuring genetic divergence within taxa. Simulations reveal that in spatially explicit isolation with migration models across the barrier, age of divergence, presence of gene flow, and presence of isolation by distance can confound the interpretation of evolutionary history and model selection by producing easily confusable results. We re-analyze five empirical genetic datasets to illustrate the utility of these simulations despite these constraints.Main Conclusions By synthesizing phylogeographic data for the Cochise Filter Barrier, we show that barriers interact with species traits to differentiate taxa in communities over millions of years.

This paper proposes a multi-system genetic algorithm (MSGA), stemming from implicit parallelism in population-based search algorithms, to solve multiple coupled subsystems simultaneously in a complex system. The proposed MSGA is composed of within-subsystem evolution and cross-subsystem migration operators. The objective of the former is to optimize each subsystem by appropriate search strategies, and the objective of the latter is to exchange information between multiple subsystems by migration, which is based on the similarity probability of objectives and constraints, and the intersection probability of solutions in different subsystems. During migration across subsystems, three statistical approaches of measuring similarity and three metrics of solution intersection in information theory are used to calculate these probabilities. Performance is tested on a set of multi-subsystem benchmark functions, and the simulation results show that cross-subsystem migration plays the key role for the performance of MSGA.

Specifically, when edge servers (ESs) execute tasks delivered by smart devices (SDs), SDs may move beyond the coverage of ESs, and computing migration (CM) of unfinished tasks is required to ensure service continuity. There is a risk of privacy leakage during task migration, and MEs use colluding eavesdropping to eavesdrop on the migrated tasks, and we consider eavesdropping on the associated tasks through data sharing among MEs to improve the eavesdropping efficiency. For eavesdropping in MEs, we achieve eavesdropping strikes using cooperative interference by jammers, which benefit by providing jamming services. In addition, uncertain computational scenarios directly affect the efficiency of task execution, and we consider the uncertainty factor in the malicious eavesdropping environment. To this end, this paper proposes the secure computational migration of associative privacy in uncertain environments (SCMAPUE) model, which transforms uncertainties into interval parameters, and optimizes the five objectives of migration delay, maximum completion time, energy consumption, load balancing and migration reliability to achieve efficient task execution and reliable migration.

Simulation results show that the migration speed is quantitatively related to frictional properties by an analytical relation derived here. By assuming that local pore water in front of the migration drives rapid tremor reversal and is so local as to hold a constant stress drop, the application of the analytical solution to observational results suggests that (a) the temporal changes of observed migration speeds for the rapid tremor reversal could be explained by about 70% reduction of the effective normal stress; (b) effective normal stress for the deeper extension of seismogenic segment in the western part of Shikoku is about 1.5 times greater than that in the central part.

When both local and global environments can be perceived by individuals, they may determine whether to migrate or not based on the comparison. If the individuals realize the local environments are worse than the global ones, they are more likely to leave their original place. Otherwise, they may choose to stay still. Considering these, we study the evolutionary games in a dynamically changing population on a square lattice, in which the players migrate based on the comparison between local and global environments. The simulation results show that cooperation can be significantly promoted. By examining the strategy patterns during the evolution, we find there exist two evolutionary stages that account for the enhancement of cooperation. One is the clustering of cooperators, in which cooperator clusters get strengthened by slow migration of cooperators and fast migration of defectors. The other is the coalescence of cooperator clusters, which induces further increment of the cooperation level. Besides, we investigate the effects of two different types of noises on cooperation, which are introduced in migration and in strategy imitation, respectively.

We show that the large-time behaviour of the solution (persistence or extinction) depends on the sign of a principal eigenvalue, lambda(H), and we study the dependency of lambda(H) with respect to H. This analysis sheds new light on the effect of increasing the number of patches on the persistence of a population, which has implications in agroecology and for understanding zoonoses; in such cases we consider a pathogenic population and the patches correspond to different host species. The occurrence of a springboard effect, where the addition of a patch contributes to persistence, or on the contrary the emergence of a detrimental effect by increasing the number of patches on the persistence, depends in a rather complex way on the respective positions in the phenotypic space of the optimal phenotypes associated with each patch. From a mathematical point of view, an important part of the difficulty in dealing with H >= 3, compared to H = 1 or H = 2, comes from the lack of symmetry. Our results, which are based on a fixed point theorem, comparison principles, integral estimates, variational arguments, rearrangement techniques, and numerical simulations, provide a better understanding of these dependencies.

The nature of coupling for connectivity also plays an important role in the co-existence of species in cyclic-dominance. The rock-paper-scissors game is one of the paradigmatic mathematical model in evolutionary game theory to understand the mecha-nism of biodiversity in cyclic-dominance. In this paper, the metapopulation model for rock-paper-scissors with mutations is presented in which the total population is divided into patches and the patches form a network of complete graph. The migration among patches is allowed through simple random walk. The replicator-mutator equations are used with the migration term. When migration is allowed then the population of the patches will synchronized and attain stable state through Hopf bifurcation. Apart form this, two phases are observed when the strategies of one of the species mutate to other two species: co-existence of all the species phase and existence of one kind of species phase. The transition from one phase to another phase is taking place due to transcritical bifurcation.

The present study addressed this challenge for the scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) which is Critically Endangered. I gathered geo-referenced occurrences of this species from online biogeographic databases, catch data, and peer-reviewed literature. I built seasonal species distribution models (SSDMs) based on these occurrences and 11 environmental variables to predict their suitable habitats. I then predicted their seasonal migration routes for population exchanges with two connectivity analysis techniques (Circuitscape, least-cost path analysis). All SSDMs performed well and showed that there were prominent divergences in seasonal distributions driven by the species' ecological niches. Generally, sea surface temperature was the most important predictor, followed by depth, salinity, primary productivity, distance to macrohabitats, and distance to shoreline. Seasonal suitable habitats were mainly found in tropical continental shelves and deep seas. Possible seasonal migration corridors for population exchanges across ocean basins were identified and some were commonly used by oceanic sharks. The present study highlights (i) the utility of integrating SDMs and connectivity-analysis techniques to predict migration routes for oceanic sharks, and (ii) seasonal and regional changes in their habitat uses, suggesting dynamic, ocean-based conservation measures are needed to conserve these marine apex predators.",Author KeywordsApex predatorConnectivity analysisConservation planningMigratory routesOceanic sharkSpecies distribution modelKeywords PlusSPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELSSPHYRNA-LEWINIPROTECTED AREASHABITAT USEBEHAVIORCONSERVATIONMOVEMENTCONNECTIVITYABSENCESTRACKING

Monthly water sampling and visual inspection was conducted, from May to September, in 32 Class A tributaries-at the river mouth and within the river channel. Hasu eDNA was extracted from water samples and quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Environmental factors were also assessed on-site, and their effects on eDNA and visual count trends evaluated using linear models and Akaike information criterion. eDNA was detected at sites where the fish were both observed and not observed. A zero-hurdle model revealed positive correlation between eDNA copies and visual counts of migrating Hasu, with pH having a reducing effect on the relationship (p < 0.05).

Then, we establish the stability of such an equilibrium using the theory of abstract non-linear parabolic problems and analyzing the spectral properties of the derivative of the operator that describes the coupled dynamics of labor and capital. We present numerical simulations which agree with our theoretical investigation and show that the proposed model allows us to detect interesting transitional dynamics that the standard Solow model does not capture.

Fish grow logistically on each patch and are caught. We assume that migrations between the two sites are fast relative to local growth and fishing. Taking advantage of the time scales, we use methods of aggregation of variables to obtain a reduced model governing the total biomass of the fish population at a slow time scale. We are looking for the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for the system of the two connected patches. We show that although the total equilibrium population may be greater than the sum of the carrying capacities on each isolated site, the total catch is always less than or equal to the sum of the catches on the isolated fishing sites.

Mathematical modelling and sim ulations predict that, in comparison to neutrality, BGS leads to reduced genetic diversity while AOD leads to an increase, with greater effects in low recombining regions. However, little is known about the impact of migration and hemizygosity (X-chromosomes or haplodiploid sex-determining system). Moreover, studies about divergent selection with migration usually ignore deleterious mutations. The objective of this thesis was to use simulations to predict genomic patterns of diversity and differenti ation resulting from the interaction between deleterious mutations, divergent selection, migration and haplodiploidy. We used forward-in-time simulations under an isolation-with-migration model with two populations, investigating variation in dominance, migration rate, recombination rate, and selective co efficients. To assess the impact of interactions between deleterious mutations and divergent selection, we performed simulations according to the demographic history from two sister species of haplodiploid Neodiprion sawflies to simulate a real-life based model. We found that the pattern of variation of the ratio of within population nucleotide diversity over its neutral expectation (π/πneutral) as a function of deleterious selective coefficient is only slightly influenced by gene flow. However, the ratio of between population differentiation (FST /FSTneutral) becomes closer to 1 as migration rate increases, suggesting a migration threshold above which linked selection has no effect on FST . We found a lower migration threshold for genomic regions under BGS than AOD. For fully and partially recessive deleterious mutations we discovered a transition between AOD and BGS as selective coefficients increased, both with and without migration. Finally, we introduce predictions for the genomic patterns of haplodiploid populations experiencing divergent selection and asymmetric gene flow.",

The underlying mechanism consists of resonant interactions between halo particles and the stellar bar. The cooling mechanism acts both on dynamical and secular timescales, i.e., from ~ 0.5 Gyr to few Gyr, and the stellar bar acts to absorb the kinetic energy of the vertical motions. Using a Milky Way-type stellar halo, we estimate the population of metal-poor disk stars which have been trapped by the MW disk and analyze its kinematics. We find that the population of metal-poor MW disk stars with $|z|\ltorder 3$\,kpc detected by the Gaia DR3 and other surveys can have their origin in the stellar halo. The cooled population also migrates radially outwards compared by acquiring energy from the spinning bar, and prograde-moving stars have a different distribution from the retrograde ones. Next, we have calculated the ratio of the prograde-to-retrograde orbits of the cooled population and found that this ratio varies radially, with the fast-spinning stellar halo resulting in the shallower radial increase of this ratio outside of the corotation. The nonspinning stellar halo shows a monotonic increase of this ratio with radius outside the corotation. Together with analyzed radial migration of these halo stars, the cooling phenomenon of halo metal-poor stars can explain their current disk population, and has corollaries for the chemical evolution of disk galaxies in general.",

Determining species vulnerability to decline, and where and how to mitigate threats, are paramount for effective conservation. We hypothesized that species with shared ecological traits also share threats, and therefore may experience similar population trends. Here, we used a Bayesian modeling framework to test whether phylogeny, geography, and 22 ecological traits predict regional population trends for 380 North American bird species. Groups like blackbirds, warblers, and shorebirds, as well as species occupying Bird Conservation Regions at more extreme latitudes in North America, exhibited negative population trends; whereas groups such as ducks, raptors, and waders, as well as species occupying more inland Bird Conservation Regions, exhibited positive trends. Specifically, we found that in addition to phylogeny and breeding geography, multiple ecological traits contributed to explaining variation in regional population trends for North American birds. Furthermore, we found that regional trends and the relative effects of migration distance, phylogeny, and geography differ between shorebirds, songbirds, and waterbirds. Our work provides evidence that multiple ecological traits correlate with North American bird population trends, but that the individual effects of these ecological traits in predicting population trends often vary between different groups of birds. Moreover, our results reinforce the notion that variation in avian population trends is controlled by more than phylogeny and geography, where closely related species within one region can show unique population trends due to differences in their ecological traits. We recommend that regional conservation plans, i.e. one-size-fits-all plans, be implemented only for bird groups with population trends under strong phylogenetic or geographic controls. We underscore the need to develop species-specific research and management strategies for other groups, like songbirds, that exhibit high variation in their population trends and are influenced by multiple ecological traits.",Author KeywordsBayesian modelingBird Conservation RegionBreeding Bird Surveymigration distanceNorth Americaecological traitsKeywords PlusUNITED-STATESEXTINCTION RISKCLIMATE-CHANGEFRESH-WATERCONSERVATIONMIGRATIONCONSEQUENCESTERRESTRIALDIVERSITYDYNAMICS

This study proposed a mathematical model, the P-C Population Accretion Growth (P-CPAG) model, to simulate key processes of population growth over a P-C period, based on the Urban Accretion Growth hypothesis (the UAG hypothesis). In the P-CPAG model, several parameters, e.g., natural increase rate of population(k), accretion rate (& rho;), accretion radius(r), and initial population size (Pot0 ), are vital for population growth. In the model examination, we determined the potential value for all parameters by the universal laws and the collected literature about the worldwide ancient cities.

Research suggests larval returns of Dungeness crabs vary annually by a factor of 1000, strongly influencing the population dynamics of the species. To understand how hydrographic conditions affect population dynamics, a light trap in Coos Bay, Oregon, was monitored daily during the recruitment season (April to September) from 1997 to 2001 and from 2006 to the present. Using an individual-based biophysical model, we tested the hypothesis that more Dungeness crab larvae recruit during negative-phase Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO).

We validated our model by comparing the model data to the light trap data. Our findings support the hypothesis that more megalopae (pelagic postlarvae) recruit during the negative phase of the PDO. In addition, megalopae appear to spend longer in the water column during positive-phase PDO as a result of faster development rates likely due to warmer seawater temperature.

Geographic cline analysis of natural hybrid zones is widely used to identify putative signatures of selection by detecting deviations from baseline patterns of introgression.

In this study, we use a forward-time individual-based simulation approach to evaluate the robustness of geographic cline analysis under different evolutionary scenarios. We modelled multiple stepping-stone hybrid zones with distinct age, deme sizes, and migration rates, and evolving under different types of selection. We found that drift distorts cline shapes and increases false positive rates for signatures of selection. This effect increases with hybrid zone age, particularly if migration between demes is low. Drift can also distort the signature of deleterious effects of hybridization, with genetic incompatibilities and particularly underdominance prone to spurious typing as adaptive introgression. Our results suggest that geographic clines are most useful for outlier analysis in young hybrid zones with large populations of hybrid individuals.

We run an N-body simulation model of the Milky Way, which we evolve for 10 Gyr, to study the secular evolution of stellar orbits and the resulting galactic habitability-related properties, i.e., the density of the stellar component and close stellar encounters. The results indicate that radial migrations are not negligible, even in a simple axisymmetric model with mild levels of dynamical heating, and that the net outward diffusion of the stellar component can populate galactic outskirts with habitable systems. Habitable environment is also likely even at sub-Solar galactocentric radii, because the rate of close encounters should not significantly degrade habitability. Stars that evolve from non-circular to stable nearly-circular orbits typically migrate outwards, settling down in a broad Solar neighborhood. The region between $R \approx 3$ kpc and $R \approx 12$ kpc represents the zone of radial mixing, which can blur the boundaries of the Galactic Habitable Zone, as it has been conventionally understood. The present-day stable population of the stars in the Solar neighborhood originates from this radial mixing zone, with most of the stars coming from the inner regions. The Solar system can be considered as a typical Milky Way habitable system because it migrated outwards from the metal-rich inner regions of the Disk and has a circular orbit in the present epoch. We conclude that the boundaries of the Galactic Habitable Zone cannot be sharply confined for a given epoch because of the mixing caused by the stellar migrations and secular evolution of stellar orbits.",

The phenotypic distance rules out the survivorship of the individuals in a patch to the optimal phenotype. Additionally, we provide our model a genetic ground, such that changes in phenotype are associated with mutational events. One simulates environmental changes as shifts of the optimum phenotype. Quite surprisingly, we find that the pattern of speciation depends only on the net effect of the environmental disturbances in a given time interval, no matter the rate at which the events occur.

In the first project, computational challenges of deriving exact model likelihoods are addressed by leveraging mechanistically motivated forward-time simulation model and employing ABC. The developed model incorporates divergent selection, variable migration rates, modes of reproduction (sexual/asexual), length and number of migration-selection cycles. The research assesses the computational feasibility of ABC and evaluates the quality of estimates regarding loci under selection and selection strength. The impact of genetic drift and recombination rate on estimation are assessed.  The second project assesses Hi-C’s precision in recovering metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) through ProxiMeta, Bin3C, and MetaTOR pipelines. The project employs precision metrics, statistical testing, and assessment of algorithmic choices and Hi-C libraries, in obtaining dependable results, contributing to understanding the influence of microbiome analysis methodologies.

We use the frequencies of monthly presence records throughout the annual cycle to identify the breeding areas (corresponding to the summer months), of winter presence (corresponding to the winter months), and annual residence (presence records throughout the year). Subsequently, we use ecological niche models to reconstruct the potential distribution of the summer and winter niches by correlating the climates of each season with the corresponding records. We evaluate the species??? climatic preferences between the breeding and winter seasons by transferring the niches from each season to the opposite and by their capacity to inter-predict records between seasons. In addition, we quantify the overlap between the summer and winter niches using a niche similarity analysis. Geographically, we see a clear seasonal turnover pattern along a north-south gradient and records throughout the year (resident populations) in the south-central region of its distribution. We observed a low inter-prediction of records between seasons. Together with the similarity analysis, we suggest that the species is niche-switching (i.e., has different seasonal niches).

Barriers such as dams interfere with freshwater fish migration, leading to drastic population declines. While there are a range of widely implemented mitigation approaches, e.g. fish passes, such measures are often inefficient due to suboptimal operation and design. There is increasing need to be able to assess mitigation options prior to implementation. Individual based models (IBMs) are a promising option. IBMs can simulate the fine-scale movement of individual fish within a population as they attempt to find a fish pass, incorporating movement processes themselves. Moreover, IBMs have high transferability to other sites or conditions (e.g. changing mitigation, change in flow conditions), making them potentially valuable for freshwater fish conservation yet their application to the finescale movement of fish past barriers is still novel. Here, we present an overview of existing IBMs for fine-scale freshwater fish movement, with emphasis on study species and the parameters driving movement in the models. In this review, we focus on IBMs suitable for the simulation of fish tracks as they approach or pass a single barrier.The selected IBMs for modelling fine-scale freshwater fish movement largely focus on salmonids and cyprinid species. IBMs have many applications in the context of fish passage, such as testing different mitigation options or understanding processes behind movement. Existing IBMs include movement processes such as attraction and rejection behaviours, as reported in literature. Yet some factors affecting fish movement e.g. biotic interactions are not covered by existing IBMs. As the technology available for fine scale data collection continues to advance, such as increasing data linking fish behaviour to hydraulics, IBMs could become a more common tool in the design and implementation of fish bypass structures.",Author KeywordsIndividual based modellingEcohydraulicsFish passageFine-scaleHigh-throughput telemetryKeywords PlusEEL ANGUILLA-ANGUILLALAGRANGIAN-AGENT METHODPASSAGE PERFORMANCEAVOIDANCE-BEHAVIORACCELERATING FLOWUPSTREAM PASSAGEMIGRATIONPATTERNSATTRACTIONFACILITIES

We reconstructed extreme event sequences, simulated social resilience response using our proposed Cascade Catastrophe-Resilience Dynamic Model, and discussed interaction of social vulnerability and stability. We found the following conclusions. First, historical extreme events had cyclic and periodic fluctuations, and usually led to cascade disasters. Cascade disasters enhanced risk and greatly reduced societal stability, while three types of disaster chains were observed: climatic extremes (flood/drought)-famines-wars (uprising/invasions)-epidemic plagues; climatic extremes (flood/drought)-famines -migrations; and droughts-locust plagues-famines. A climate extreme-earthquake chain was also recorded although the mechanism remains unknown. Second, extreme events were synchronous with dynastic changes, although strong social resilience enhanced the opportunity for dynastic survival and modified the stochastic magnitude-frequency relationship between extreme events and social vulnerability. The high frequency of extreme events is consistent with high hazard indices, declining population, high levels of social vulnerability, and low levels of social stability and resilience. However, the strong correlation between high levels of social vulnerability and high frequency of extreme events occurred at the end of dynasties but not when dynasties were thriving. Third, quick response to disasters, efficient disaster relief systems, and sufficient food supplies were essential parts of social resilience to disasters. Extreme events play important roles in shaping agricultural production, and thus food supply. Population fluctuation and migration, economic center shifts, and social and economic structure changes contributed to cascade disasters, which often led to societal instability throughout Chinese history.",Author KeywordsExtreme eventsSocial resilienceCascade Catastrophe-Resilience Dynamic Model (CCRDM)Ancient ChinaKeywords PlusCLIMATE-CHANGERISKSTRATEGIESDEPOSITSIMPACTSLESSONSLOESSRIVER

When the population is stable, we show that semelparous species with precocious maturation and iteroparous species with delayed maturation exhibit higher diversity because their life history traits tend to balance the lifetimes of non reproductive individuals (juveniles) and adults which reproduce. Then, we extend our model to a metapopulation to investigate the additional effect of dispersal on diversity. We show that dispersal may truly modify the local effect of life history on diversity. As a result, the diversity at the global scale of the metapopulation differ from the local diversity which is only described through local life history traits of the populations.

There are many factors that affect intercity population mobility, such as socioeconomic attributes, geographical distance, and industrial structure. The complexity of the coupling among these factors makes it difficult to simulate intercity population mobility. To address this issue, we propose a novel method named the quantum harmonic oscillator model for simulation of intercity population mobility (QHO-IPM). QHO-IPM describes the intercity population mobility as being affected by coupled driving factors that work as a multioscillator-coupled quantum harmonic oscillator system, which is further transformed by the oscillation process of an oscillator, namely, the breaking point of intercity population mobility. The intercity population mobility among seven cities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and its surrounding region is taken as an example for verifying the QHO-IPM. The experimental results show that (1) compared with the reference methods (the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and long and short-term memory (LSTM) models), the QHO-IPM achieves better simulation performance regarding intercity population mobility in terms of both overall trend and mutation. (2) The simulation error in the QHO-IPM for different-level intercity population mobility is small and stable, which illustrates the weak sensitivity of the QHO-IPM to intercity population mobility under different structures.

One popular solution, agent-based models (ABM) cope well with dynamics and het-erogeneity, but often lack rigorous foundations in terms of individual behavior. Moreover, given limited exposure to actual climate change, it can be a challenge to build adequate behavioral models of migration choice based on historical data. To tackle this issue, we build an ABM of future migration using a bespoke choice experiment (CE) designed to examine intention to migrate among farmers living in the Vietnamese Mekong Delta (VMD). In the CE, respondents are asked to make migration choices for scenarios constructed using six attributes: drought intensity, flood frequency, income gain from migration, migration networks, neighbors' choice, and crop choice restriction. The simulation runs to 2050 and is based on two scenarios of future global emissions of greenhouse gases-Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5. The results suggest potentially high levels of migration as a result of climate change and the particular importance of positive feedback from pre-existing migration and neighbor's choices. The results also suggest that crop-restriction regulations have a significant impact on migration for coastal provinces of VMD.

We simulated potential migration, accounting for various traits that affect species' ability to track climatically suitable habitat.Location: Eastern Canada, covering similar to 3.7 million km(2).Methods: We simulated migration-constrained range shifts through 2100 using a hybrid approach combining projections of climatically suitable habitat based on two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5, RCP8.5) for three time periods and two species distribution modelling approaches with process-based models parameterized using data related to dispersal ability and generation time. We developed a unique ""migration kernel"" that uses seed dispersal traits and observed migration velocities to obtain kernel shape and dispersal probabilities for each tree species. We then calculated lags between the migration-constrained range limits obtained through simulations and limits of climatically suitable habitat.Results: All species demonstrated northward range shifts at the leading edge of their simulated distribution through 2100, but the magnitude and rate of that shift varied by species and time period. Climatically suitable habitat limits were found to be north of simulated distribution limits across both RCPs, with lags increasing through time. On average, simulated distribution that remained within climatically suitable habitat declined more under RCP8.5 than RCP4.5, with large areas of the rear edge of the simulated distribution becoming partially or completely climatically unsuitable for many species.Main conclusions: Climatically suitable habitat limits projected for 2100 far exceeded migration-constrained range limits for all 10 tree species, particularly for temperate species.

In spring, males often arrive on the breeding grounds before females (protandry), though whether these patterns result from fitness benefits vs. sex-specific constraints on arrival timing remains poorly understood. Sex-specific variation in the timing of fall migration is less well-documented than in spring, in part because documenting fall departures is often limited by cryptic behaviors, lower vocalization rates, and shifting territory boundaries during this time of year. We used 2 years of high-resolution encounter data from radio-frequency identification (RFID)-equipped bird feeders to monitor the daily presence of male and female Lazuli Buntings (Passerina amoena) throughout the breeding season at a high and a low-elevation site in Cache County, Utah, USA. These encounter data were used to estimate daily arrival and departure probabilities and to investigate possible differences in migration timing in relation to sex and elevation. At low elevation, male arrival (n = 15) preceded female arrival (n = 16) by similar to 1 week, consistent with previous research that has documented protandry in other migratory songbirds. At high elevation, however, no significant differences were found between male (n = 19) and female arrival (n = 6). In fall, we found little difference in departure dates between elevation or sex, or between years. Our observations are most consistent with constraint-based hypotheses explaining protandry, possibly relating to sex-specific constraints operating during the nonbreeding period. We additionally emphasize the need for quantifying uncertainty in phenological estimates and importance of addressing potential differences across demographic groups.",Author KeywordsBayesian point-process modelelevational gradientLazuli Buntingmark-recapturemigratory phenologyprotandryRFIDKeywords PlusCLIMATE-CHANGESPRING MIGRATIONENERGETIC CONDITIONAUTUMN MIGRATIONPOPULATION-SIZEFALL MIGRATIONBIRD MIGRATIONLONG-TERMARRIVALDEPARTURE

We estimated genetic structure with clustering algorithms in STRUCTURE and GENETIX. We estimated genetic distances by characterizing patterns of pair-wise F-ST using the program FSTAT, evaluating differences among and between regions via AMOVA, and testing isolation by distance in IBDWS. To estimate and date the most likely pathway by which P. perna crossed the Atlantic Ocean we used Bayesian factors from thermodynamically heated coalescent simulations in the program MIGRATE-n. Results We found no general pattern of reduced or elevated levels of genetic diversity within any region across site or locus. We identified four genetic clusters: East South Africa (ESA), West South Africa (WSA), Brazil (BR) and North Africa (MO); F-ST ranged from 0.06 to 0.11 among regions and exhibited a significant pattern of isolation by distance. Migration models indicated that P. perna dispersed from WSA to MO and from there to BR of approximately 2,000 years. Main conclusions Multiple lines of evidence suggest the Brazilian populations of P. perna have been a long-standing native population, originating from northern Africa and are unlikely a consequence of the African slave trade.

In this scenario, stellar flybys excite the eccentricity and inclination of an outer planet (or brown dwarf) at large distance (10-300 au), which then triggers high-e migration of an inner cold Jupiter (at a few au) through the combined effects of von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) eccentricity oscillation and tidal dissipation.

The simulations showed that the first 3 months of the year are crucial for the species because this is when it is most affected by a combination of fishing, biological factors which increase natural mortality (e.g. upstream migration and predation) and environmental factors (e.g. low river flow).

Genetic rescue (GR) is a conservation tool that is studied and deployed with the aim of increasing the fitness of such inbred populations by assisted migration of individuals from closely related outbred populations. The success of GR depends on several factors-such as their demographic history and distribution of dominance effects of mutations-that may vary across populations. While we understand the impact of these factors on the dynamics of GR, their impact on local adaptations remains unclear. To this end, we conduct a population genetics simulation study to evaluate the impact of trait complexity (Mendelian vs. polygenic), dominance effects, and demographic history on the efficacy of GR. We find that the impact on local adaptations depends highly on the mutational load at the time of GR, which is in turn shaped dynamically by interactions between demographic history and dominance effects of deleterious variation. Over time local adaptations are generally restored post-GR, though in the short term they are often compromised in the process of purging deleterious variation. We also show that while local adaptations are almost always fully restored, the degree to which ancestral genetic variation affecting the trait is replaced by donor variation can vary drastically and is especially high for complex traits.

We begin with the case where all spatial locations can support a viable population, and then consider the case where there are non-viable regions in the habitat. If the viable regions vary seasonally, and the viable regions in summer and winter do not overlap, dispersal may really be necessary for sustaining a population. Our findings generally align with previous findings in the literature that were based on other modeling frameworks, namely that dispersal strategies associated with ideal free distributions are evolutionarily stable. In the case where only part of the habitat can sustain a population, we show that a partial occupation ideal free distribution that occupies only the viable region is associated with a dispersal strategy that is evolutionarily stable.

Detection technologies, such as passive integrated transponder (PIT) antennas or sonic receivers, can be placed at boundaries between habitats (e.g. near the confluence of rivers) to detect migratory movements of marked animals. Often, these detection systems have high detection probabilities and detect many individuals but are limited in their ability to make inferences about abundance because only marked individuals can be detected. Here, we introduce a mark-recapture modelling approach that uses detections from a double-array PIT antenna system to imply movement directionality from arrays and estimate migration timing. Additionally, when combined with physical captures, the model can be used to estimate abundances for both migratory and non-migratory groups and help quantify partial migration. We first test our approach using simulation, and results indicate our approach displayed negligible bias for total abundance (less than +/- 1%) and slight biases for state-specific abundance estimates (+/- 1%-6%). We fit our model to array detections and physical captures of three native fishes (humpback chub [Gila cypha], flannelmouth sucker [Catostomus latipinnis] and bluehead sucker [Catostomus discobolus]) in the Little Colorado River (LCR) in Grand Canyon, AZ, a system that exhibits partial migration (i.e. includes residents and migrants). Abundance estimates from our model confirm that, for all three species, migratory individuals are much more numerous than residents. There was little difference in movement timing between 2021 (a year without preceding winter/spring floods) and 2022 (a year with a small flood occurring in early April). In both years, flannelmouth sucker arrived in mid-March whereas humpback chub and bluehead sucker arrivals occurred early- to mid-April. With humpback chub and flannelmouth sucker, movement timing was influenced by body size so that large individuals were more likely to arrive early compared to smaller individuals. With more years of data, this model framework could be used to evaluate ecological questions pertaining to flow cues and movement timing or intensity, relative trends in migrants versus residents and ecological drivers of skipped spawning.Partial migration is common across taxa and there are numerous technologies that can detect animals that are actively migrating between habitats. We introduce a modelling method to evaluate migration timing and estimate abundances of residents and migrants.

Objectives In this study, we investigated the effects of rivers and other abiotic factors, such as climate and geography on genetic variation of a highly aquatic frog (Pseudis tocantins) inhabiting central Brazil. Methods We sequenced fragments of one mitochondrial and two nuclear genes of 179 individuals of P. tocantins from 19 localities along the Tocantins-Araguaia Basin in Brazil and used Generalized Dissimilarity Modeling (GDM) to test the role of rivers, landscape, and climate features on its genetic differentiation. Next, we tested three scenarios of migration along the Tocantins-Araguaia Basin using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). Results We found that genetic differentiation among localities is mostly explained by the influence of river connectivity. Conversely, elevation, slope, and past and current climate have little or no impact on genetic differentiation. Furthermore, our results show that patterns of migration took place directionally, from upstream to downstream sites. Conclusions Rivers have shaped patterns of intraspecific diversity in P. tocantins by acting as the most important facilitator of gene flow.

The population of scattering TNOs are known to 'stick' to Neptune's resonances while evolving in semimajor axis ($a$), though simulations show that resonance sticking is less prevalent at $a\gtrsim200-250$ au. Here we present an extensive numerical exploration of the strengths of Neptune's resonances for scattering TNOs with perihelion distances $q=33$ au. We show that the drop-off in resonance sticking for the large $a$ scattering TNOs is not a generic feature of scattering dynamics, but can instead be attributed to the specific configuration of Neptune and Uranus in our solar system. In simulations with just Uranus removed from the giant planet system, Neptune's resonances are strong in the scattering population out to at least $\sim300$ au. Uranus and Neptune are near a 2:1 period ratio, and the variations in Neptune's orbit resulting from this near resonance are responsible for destabilizing Neptune's resonances for high-$e$ TNO orbits beyond the $\sim20$:1 resonance at $a\approx220$ au. Direct interactions between Uranus and the scattering population are responsible for slightly weakening Neptune's closer-in resonances. In simulations where Neptune and Uranus are placed in their mutual 2:1 resonance, we see almost no stable libration of scattering particles in Neptune's external resonances.

The animals are distributed in space such that each animal moves optimally, seeking regions which offer high growth rates and low mortalities, subject to costs on excessive movements as well as being in regions with high densities of conspecifics. The model applies to repeated scenarios such as diel or seasonal patterns, where the animals are aware of both current and future environmental conditions. We show that this problem can be viewed as a differential game of mean field type, and that the evolutionary stable solution, i.e., the Nash equilibrium, is characterized by partial differential equations, which govern the distributions and migration velocities of animals. These equations have similarities to equations that appear in the fluid dynamics, specifically the Euler equations for compressible inviscid fluids. If the environment is constant, the ideal free distribution emerges as an equilibrium. We illustrate the theory with a numerical example of vertical migrations of oceanic copepods, where animals are attracted to nutrient-rich surface waters while repulsed from light during daytime due to the presence of visual predators, aiming to reduce both proximity to conspecifics and swimming efforts.

While continuum models based on linear diffusion are routinely employed and known to capture key experimental observations, linear diffusion fails to predict well-defined sharp fronts that are often observed experimentally. This observation has motivated the use of nonlinear degenerate diffusion, however these nonlinear models and the associated parameters lack a clear biological motivation and interpretation. Here we take a different approach by developing a stochastic discrete lattice-based model incorporating biologically-inspired mechanisms and then deriving the reaction-diffusion continuum limit. Inspired by experimental observations, agents in the simulation deposit extracellular material, that we call a substrate, locally onto the lattice, and the motility of agents is taken to be proportional to the substrate density. Discrete simulations that mimic a two--dimensional circular barrier assay illustrate how the discrete model supports both smooth and sharp-fronted density profiles depending on the rate of substrate deposition.
