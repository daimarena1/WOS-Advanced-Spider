Although previous theories have explained the factors affecting urban renewal, such studies have failed to identify the differences among the drivers of multifunctional types of urban renewal, leading generalized urban renewal policies to fail. To extend the urban renewal theory from a typological perspective, this paper presents a study that identified the similarities and differences in the mechanisms of the multifunctional types of urban renewal projects implemented in Shenzhen, China. Multisource data, such as planning permits, were used to identify the urban renewal projects implemented in Shenzhen, China, between 2010 and 2020 as well as the prerenewal and postrenewal functions of these projects. The results indicate that 1) the regression model accuracy is 60.3 % for urban renewal as a whole. The classification of urban renewal projects improves the goodness of fit of the regression model by 0.16. 2) Land location, land prices, and policies were found to exert a greater influence on urban renewal than other factors, indicating that public demand plays a weaker role in driving urban renewal projects than the government or developers do. 3) The major types of urban renewal can be categorized into three typical driving modes: government-oriented urban renewal, which includes new industrial and public service projects; production-oriented urban renewal, which includes the conversion of industrial land into commercial or residential functions; and consumption-oriented urban renewal, including new residential projects implemented to accommodate the housing needs of an increasing population. Urban planners and policymakers can apply the results to classify urban renewal projects and adopt appropriate strategies for each type to achieve reasonable resource allocation and sustainable development.",Author KeywordsUrban renewalSpatial governanceDriving forcesPlanning permitThe Rent Gap TheoryKeywords PlusLAND-USE CHANGENEW-YORK-CITYRENT-GAPINDUSTRIAL LANDTOURISM GENTRIFICATIONDECISION-MAKINGREDEVELOPMENTREGENERATIONEXPERIENCESPOLICIES

However, the impact of urban renewal on housing prices remains inconclusive, closely tied to the characteristics of the study area, the sources of research data, and so on. To address this, we employ the difference-in-difference method and a mixed panel dataset of housing transactions from 2010 to 2021 to analyze in detail the effects of different urban renewal types (Industrial Renewal, Residential Renewal, and Commercial Renewal) on surrounding housing prices in Bao'an District at different renewal phases (announcement, start, and completion). We found that In-dustrial Renewal exerts the most significant impact on housing prices at the beginning and completion of renewal, followed by Residential Renewal and Commercial Renewal. Moreover, Urban renewal generates both positive and negative externalities on housing prices, especially in the case of numerous small-scale renewal projects. The findings suggest that urban renewal should be supported by systematic research on renewal types, the establishment of scale entry threshold, and the monitoring of the entire process.",Author KeywordsUrban renewal typesHousing pricesStagesScaleShenzhenKeywords PlusSCHOOL-DISTRICTQUALITYPROJECTGROWTHAREACITY

The research categorizes renewal projects based on changes in buildings, underlying surfaces, and functions. Using the Spearman correlation coefficient and LOWESS method, the study analyzes the relationships between cooling effects and impact factors. The results reveal that transforming industrial areas into commercial or residential zones and transitioning from compact mid-rise to open high-rise structures have significant cooling effects. However, the renewal implementation of the latter transformation can exacerbate the local UHI, suggesting the need for optimizing the timeline of such projects. Increasing vegetation cover plays a crucial role in mitigating the UHI, while higher floor area ratios and building volumes do not necessarily intensify the UHI. To improve the urban ecosystem, urban renewal planning should prioritize the creation of blue and green spaces, incorporation of natural infrastructure, and reduction of impervious surfaces.

The research findings, outlining the urban renewal matrix-that is, the costs and benefits of urban renewal for various residents-reflect a complex reality with positive and negative consequences for different resident groups. Although urban renewal has significantly improved the housing conditions and surrounding environment, and although it promises some residents substantial future financial gain, it has also created a divided community, imposed pronounced affordability burdens that expose disadvantaged residents to economic displacement, and has not adequately adapted transportation and education services to population growth and residents' expectations.

A multi-scale study",SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND SOCIETY,MAR 2024,7,"Increasing residential segregation is emerging as a hindrance to urban sustainability. Urban renewal projects that claim alignment with sustainable development goals still lack comprehensive studies of their impact on social segregation, as evidenced by the ongoing scholarly debate over whether urban renewal has a positive or negative effect on social segregation. This paper explores the dynamics of urban spatial segregation, analyzes the role of urban renewal on segregation, and bridges the gap in existing research by considering dynamic changes, multiple spatial scales, and diverse renewal types. Using multi -source data - house price data, planning permit data and points of interest -stepwise regression models are combined with t -test methods to examine the impact of multiple types of urban renewal on local and regional residential segregation in Shenzhen. Our findings are as follows: 1) Income -based segregation in Shenzhen increased from 0.77 to 0.81 across neighborhoods, from 0.62 to 0.73 across sub -districts, and from 0.58 to 0.67 across districts between 2000 and 2020, therefore increasing at all scales but with more pronounced growth of segregation observed between units at larger scales; 2) Urban renewal can lead to greater income similarity amongst residents of a sub -district, by attracting more high -income people to move in, but this can lead to increased residential segregation of high- and low-income people at the macro -scale. 3) When assessing the impact of urban renewal on segregation, it is recommended to consider the variations in outcomes resulting from temporal changes, spatial scales, the types of renewal, the types of segregation, and the stages of urbanization.

Despite the high-value capture capacity of urban renewal projects, value capture cannot be achieved in all urban renewal areas depending on differences in the projects. The aim of this study is to examine public value capture capacity in a renewal project area centrally located, offering high housing demand and supply, and enabling high development rights. The study is based on a scenario work in the Fikirtepe Urban Renewal Project in Istanbul (Turkey). In this study, public value capture capacity is examined by taking into consideration each stage in the urban renewal process. In the process, 'land contribution' from the land of property owners, and 'the infrastructure participation fee' are taken according to plan notes and these can be evaluated within the scope of public value capture. However, these are limited to only 1.8% of the total real estate value.

In another way, achieving sustainable urban development requires more improvements. Equity, sustainability, and universality are core principles of sustainable development and should be integrated into urban renewal strategies. For instance, urban renewal in old town areas presents multiple challenges, including balancing public investment needs, social justice considerations, and environmental impacts. Studies have shown that inequalities often arise during implementation, disproportionately affecting low-income residents in old town areas. While energy justice is a key concept for reducing these inequalities during renewal process, however existing frameworks lack a multi-dimensional approach. This study proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework that combines sustainable development with energy justice principles during the renewal of old town areas. This framework aims to achieve equitable and sustainable development outcomes in renewal of old urban areas by systematically examining the unequal impacts on lowincome groups and proposing equitable energy services and inclusive policies. The proposed equity evaluation framework includes two key components: 1) Main factors in existing renewal strategies, which include equitable access to energy resources, sustainable energy systems, affordability, and public participation. 2) Criteria for refining energy justice evaluation framework, which include accessibility, energy efficiency, community participation, and policy coordination. The research emphasizes the importance of fairness in providing affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy opportunities within urban renewal initiatives. This focus can provide rational perspective and reference for decision makers, thereby empowering vulnerable groups, giving equitable energy access and contributing to achieve sustainable urban development.",Author KeywordsSustainable developmentEnergy justiceUrban renewalLow-income groupsKeywords PlusINDICATOR SYSTEMVULNERABILITYTRANSITIONSPERSPECTIVEFRAMEWORKPOVERTYAREAS

Such a task is particularly important in an older built environment in many early developed cities, where large-scale urban renewal has been difficult to implement. Consequently, wind corridors are unlikely to be created to transfer heat away from cities, as suggested by previous studies. This study used computer simulations to assess the extent to which changes in building forms could drive wind flow through small-scale renewal sites. The removal of small, fragmented buildings during the renewal process was found to be of great significance for improving local ventilation, which can be regulated through urban design strategies with a low building coverage ratio. Moreover, adjusting the floor area ratio could help create open spaces that benefit on-site and off-site wind environments. This study highlighted small-scale urban renewal projects and their contribution to improving ventilation and mitigating urban heat island effects. These projects can be applied in urban renewal and regeneration through urban design guidelines for the regulation of the spatial distribution of buildings. Of note, wind factors must be integrated into site planning and architectural design processes. In conclusion, the incorporation of wind factors into planning and design processes will help combat urban heat island effects in cities.",Author KeywordsUrban designUrban heat islandVentilation corridorUrban renewalLeast cost path (LCP)Computational fluid dynamics (CFD)Keywords PlusCOMPUTATIONAL FLUID-DYNAMICSTHERMAL COMFORTLAND-USEGREEN INFRASTRUCTUREVENTILATIONIMPACTCITYPARKURBANIZATIONMICROCLIMATE

However, few studies consider the built environment when assessing urban renewal potential because it is difficult to measure. Street view images can show the physical setting of a place for humans to perceive the built environment. Hence, we separately extracted emotional and visual perceptions from street view images to construct a new comprehensive indicator set to assess multi-class urban renewal potentials. To establish the assessment model, we applied a backpropagation neural network based on the presence and background learning (PBL-BPNN). The renewal potential assessment based on the proposed indi-cator set can reach the highest accuracy. Emotional perceptions contribute more to assessing renewal potential than visual perceptions because they are more consistent in portraying the blighted built environment. Emotionally, the ratings of safety, boring, depression, and lively are stable in the blighted built environment. Visually, greenness and imageability often remain at lower values, highlighting the importance of greenspace and urban furniture in determining urban renewal. Furthermore, multi-class renewal potentials can be used for scenario analysis by assuming different renewal intentions.

However, people often seek unilateral economic benefits and ignore the coupling and coordination degree of economy-social ecological and environmental benefits. This paper attempts to evaluate the success and sustainability of urban renewal projects based on the coupling coordination degree (CCD) of economic-social-ecological benefits. Firstly, this study relies on a literature review and structural interviews to build a coupling indicator system of economic-social-ecological benefits of urban renewal projects and calculates the weight of evaluation indicators based on the entropy method. Taking 15 urban renewal projects in Guangzhou as objects, this research measures their CCD and explores the coupling relationship. The research results show that (1) among the 60 comprehensive benefit evaluation indicator elements of urban renewal projects, the indicator element with a larger weight is ""Education support facilities,"" the economic benefit indicator element with greater weight is ""Regional housing price of renewal areas,"" and the ecological benefit indicator element with a large weight is ""Vitality, and health of the urban landscape, and the characteristics of meeting the needs of residents of all ages."" (2) From the project dimension, the evaluation value of the social, economic, and ecological environment benefits of different reconstruction projects have certain differences. From the perspective of the regional dimension, the CCD of comprehensive benefits of urban renewal projects has obvious regional differences. The projects with a high CCD are mostly distributed in the most economically developed regions. The economic and social benefits of the renewal projects located in the economic core of the city center are usually higher, but their eco-environmental benefits are not necessarily the highest.

During the rapid development, rural villages have been absorbed and transformed into urban villages. Urban villages influence residents' lives and the housing market. However, studies on such interaction are not comprehensive. Although renewal plans have been executed in many Chinese cities, little empirical evidence on the effect of renewal was raised. Most studies obtained an average effect while neglected the varying influences of urban villages on people from different social classes. Thus, the real mechanism of the effect of urban villages and the renewal remains unclear. Therefore, this study uses the hedonic price model, the difference-in-difference model, and the quantile regression model to explore the impact of urban villages and the renewal. The empirical results show that: (1) from the overall perspective, urban villages show negative externalities on the surrounding housing price - housing price drops by 0.005% with every 1% closer to urban villages and decreases by 0.023% with every 1% increase in the scale of urban village; (2) from the social perspective, the effect of urban villages presents significant social heterogeneity - residents of higher-priced housing are more negatively affected by urban village accessibility and scale; and (3) urban village renewal positively affects surrounding housing price and compensates the negative externalities of urban village accessibility and scale. In addition, such compensating effect is significantly higher on higher-priced housing than that on lower-priced housing.

In contrast, the existing urban renewal development plan does not adequately utilize the potential of the Shiqiao (SQ) area. This study, therefore, proposes that to increase land-use efficiency and subsequently economic development, the SQ area should either start from the current conditions or adapt its current strategy to renewal.

In designated renewal areas, residents/landowners are often subject to several episodes of waiting: waiting for the public authority for information on redevelopment visions; waiting for the plans and projects to become public; waiting for the court ruling if they appeal the plans; waiting for demolition upon plan approvals; and, finally, waiting for the constructions to be completed. Given the complexity of actors and institutions involved in the waiting, it becomes a conflictual political process. This prolonged waiting leads to an ongoing temporariness and precarious spaces of urban renewal. The course of waiting affects the reorganization of the city space ""now"" and in the future. We analyze two protracted urban renewal projects from Turkey, Fikirtepe in Istanbul and Karabaglar in Izmir, to explore how residents' decade-long waiting for urban change are shaped and how these diverse waiting experiences lead to different outcomes for the progression of the state-imposed urban renewal agendas. While Karabaglar residents have unified around active bottom-up resistance from the beginning to challenge the project-based plans the central government imposed, Fikirtepe residents pursued individual-level negotiations with developers to maximize private returns following the zoning incentives the public authority gave. Despite the socio-spatial similarities between these designated urban renewal project sites, variances in residents' collective waiting strategies have led to different urban politics around project-based urban change.",Author KeywordsWaitingurban renewaltemporal politicslarge-scale redevelopmentTurkeyKeywords PlusSPACESSTATESUBJECTIVITYTEMPORALITYECONOMYCITIESSCALEPOWERTIME

Urban Renewal is the process of revitalizing these neglected and decayed areas within a city to improve the physical environment and quality of life for residents. Effective urban renewal efforts can transform these environments, enhancing their appeal and livability. However, current research lacks simulation tools that can quantitatively assess and visualize the impacts of renewal efforts, often relying on subjective judgments. Such tools are crucial for planning and implementing effective strategies by providing a clear visualization of potential changes and their impacts.

We investigate urban renewal in Beijing from 2006 to 2021 using directional distribution, spatial autocorrelation, and hotspot analysis. The findings are as follows: (1) The functional preference of each type of entity differs. While most private companies and other profit-oriented entities concentrate on producer services and residential functions, policy-oriented entities dominate the urban regeneration of public service activities. (2) Every entity shows a significant agglomeration characteristic, yet exhibits a differentiated spatial response pattern. Those entities with stronger leasing ability prefer the central zone while others are the opposite. (3) Diverse types of entities have differentiated spatiotemporal evolutions. The spatial directional divergence of state-owned enterprises and scientific research institutes has increased between 2006 and 2021. This is mainly influenced by the policy of relieving Beijing of nonessential functions. However, the rest entities show a balanced spatial development trend with the difference in each direction becoming smaller. Furthermore, the center of gravity of profit-oriented entities has shifted from the suburbs to the central zone due to a combination of administrative and market forces, whereas the center of gravity of policy-oriented entities tends to move outward from the central zone.",Author KeywordsUrban renewalEntity typesFunctional preferenceSpatial evolutionInfluencing factorsKeywords PlusFOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENTLOCATION CHOICECHINALANDFIRMSTRANSFORMATIONAGGLOMERATIONPATTERNS

We used normalized land surface temperature (NLST) and urban heat island ratio index (URI) as the surface thermal environment measurement indicators, by combining vegetation index and impervious surface cove-rage, and used M-K trend analysis and interpretation analysis. The results showed that the linear growth rate of LST in Shanghai was 0.09 degrees C.a(-1) (2002-2020), and that URI showed a trend of first increasing (2002-2010) and then decreasing (2010-2020). The mean summer LST was generally in the order of urban core>suburban>rural. 1.6% of the areas showed a significant cooling trend, of which 54.0% were distributed in the urban core. 39.5% of the regions showed a significant warming trend, of which 77.6% were distributed in the suburban. In general, there were concentrated significant cooling areas in the highly urbanized urban areas, while there was a significant warming trend in the suburban. The transformation from urban expansion to urban renewal was the main reason for the emergence of concentrated and significant cooling areas in the urban.

Due to the discontinuity and the existence of dead end roads in the recreational path network in old towns, the comfort of residents' recreational activities is restricted. The self-organization of recreational path network means that the top-down planning and design mode is difficult to match the needs of citizens. How to deduce the spatial vitality of recreation planning in a bottom-up mode and then identify potential land plots is an important issue to improve the quality of urban recreational path network. By taking the old town in Guangzhou as an example, this paper constructs the indicators of break degree and spatial vibrancy based on the complex network theory. Then, by using GPS trajectory data to identify the breaks in the existing recreational path network, the identification of discontinuous breaks based on citizen recreation behavior and the activation effect of urban renewal projects are quantitatively discussed, and the potential impacts brought by the implementation of renewal projects are simulated. The discontinuity analysis shows that the break degree of the recreational path network in the old town in Guangzhou is generally low, and the connection degree is good, but there are still some obvious breaks due to the street location and historical problems. Moreover, the results of spatial vibrancy deduction show that urban renewal projects have a positive impact on the self-organized recreational path network, and that the implementation plan and schedule of urban recreation quality improvement projects can be determined according to the deduction analysis results. This study makes a beneficial exploration of urban self-organizing characteristics from the perspectives of planning and transportation, and makes up for the deficiency of top-down planning in considering urban self-organized recreational path network.",complex networksarrow_drop_downGlobal Positioning Systemarrow_drop_downnetwork theory (graphs)arrow_drop_downtown and country planningarrow_drop_downtraffic engineering computingarrow_drop_down

This is also an example of the city government's active promotion of urban renewal plans to improve the city's appearance. Based on this case study and in order to help develop appropriate urban renewal plans, the authors of this paper present the following four conclusions: (1) Taipei has shear-band displaced landform features and the shear banding effect keeps the onsite low-plastic silt alluvium in a soft state; (2) the static and seismic ultimate bearing capacities of building foundations are seriously overestimated due to improper assumptions made in the derivation of the relevant formulas; (3) the old four-floor building would have remained safe during a tectonic earthquake; however, the new twenty-story building does not remain safe during a tectonic earthquake; and (4) landlords will benefit greatly from urban renewal but only if their buildings remain safe after reconstruction. In this case study, the new twenty-story building was found to be unsafe during a tectonic earthquake, and the landlord could therefore risk heavy losses. Therefore, the authors suggest that before a large number of urban renewal plans are promoted in Taipei, the seismic design codes for buildings should be revised so that the static and seismic ultimate bearing capacities of the proposed building foundations can be correctly calculated. This is the only way to ensure that buildings complying with seismic design specifications remain safe during tectonic earthquakes.",

The widespread use of urban green plastic cover (GPC) at construction sites and the development of high-resolution satellites have made it possible to extract the spatial distribution of construction sites and provide a basis for environmental protection authorities to protect against dust sources. Existing GPC extraction methods based on remote sensing images are either difficult to obtain the exact boundary of GPC or cannot provide corresponding algorithms according to different application scenarios. In order to determine the distribution of green plastic cover in the built-up area, this paper selects a variety of typical machine learning algorithms to classify the land cover of the test area image and selects K-nearest neighbor as the best machine learning algorithm through accuracy evaluation. Then multiple deep learning methods were used and the top networks with high overall scores were selected by comparing various aspects. Then these networks were used to predict the GPC of the test area image, and the accuracy evaluation results showed that the segmentation accuracy of deep learning was much higher than that of machine learning methods, but it took more time to predict.

We found that the thermal environment in the YRD had undergone deterioration trends, with the fastest warming trend observed in urban new towns (2.30 degrees C/decade). Although the urban cores had the highest LST, 15.91 % of urban cores exhibited a cooling trend, especially in cities with higher urbanization levels, which was caused by restored vegetation through urban renewal. Population density had the highest positive contributions in urban cores (21.08 %), while anthropogenic heat emissions accounted 21.87 % of the warming trend in urban new towns.

This helps reveal how urban form evolution impacts the thermal environment. Previous research often used isolated images, ignoring the temporal dimension of thermal infrared and reflectance data from Landsat sensors. Additionally, cost-effective and efficient methods for reconstructing time-series built height are lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we utilized Landsat time-series data to reconstruct the yearly trends in urban form in Beijing, China, spanning from 1990 to 2020. Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) time series analysis method was used to identify urban growth and renewal years. Employing a reference height for 2020 and logical reasoning method, we reconstructed the annual dynamics of built-up heights, pinpointing years of significant change. Finally, we analyzed the alterations in urban form over the past three decades and their impact on surface temperature changes. Our change detection method achieved an overall accuracy of 86 %, demonstrating its effectiveness in determining the year of change. When compared with data from Lianjia and LiDAR point cloud, our height reconstruction method showed impressive accuracy, with R-2 values of 0.9773 and 0.9526, respectively. Analysis of summer and winter LST values revealed distinct temperature patterns across different building heights, with mid-rise buildings exhibiting the highest LST in summer and low-rise buildings registering the highest LST in winter. During periods of urban growth, both mean and amplitude values of LST increased, while during urban renewal (demolition), they decreased. The date of annual temperature peaks advanced during urban growth but delayed during urban renewal (demolition).

These regions, with their diverse architectural styles, have traditionally required extensive preliminary research, often leading to subjective results. However, the advent of machine learning models has opened up new avenues for generating building facade images. Despite this, creating high-quality images for historical district renovations remains challenging, due to the complexity and diversity inherent in such districts. In response to these challenges, our study introduces a new methodology for automatically generating images of historical arcade facades, utilizing Stable Diffusion models conditioned on textual descriptions. By classifying and tagging a variety of arcade styles, we have constructed several realistic arcade facade image datasets. We trained multiple low-rank adaptation (LoRA) models to control the stylistic aspects of the generated images, supplemented by ControlNet models for improved precision and authenticity. Our approach has demonstrated high levels of precision, authenticity, and diversity in the generated images, showing promising potential for real-world urban renewal projects. This new methodology offers a more efficient and accurate alternative to conventional design processes in urban renewal, bypassing issues of unconvincing image details, lack of precision, and limited stylistic variety. Future research could focus on integrating this two-dimensional image generation with three-dimensional modeling techniques, providing a more comprehensive solution for renovating architectural facades in historical districts.",

This gap is significant, as many residents must vacate their homes for an average of 3-5 years during Shantytown redevelopment, which brings about challenges of renting houses and the associated negative impacts on their well-being before returning to their resettled homes. Therefore, this study focuses on examining the temporary residence arising during Shantytown redevelopment while awaiting resettlement. We selected Heze city as our case study area, which has been through China's most intensive redevelopment between 2016 and 2018 that affected about 1.2 million population. A structured community survey was conducted, and 1035 valid samples were collected. We then applied spatiotemporal analysis and the Random Forest model to examine stability, direction, and distance of temporary residence mobility, along with its influencing factors. Findings reveal that 92.4% of households move just once or twice during the temporary phase, indicating the preference for stable residence. Regarding moving direction, households seek life service centers rather than city centers, and prefer familiar community environments. Furthermore, 74.8% of households resettled within 2.5 km of their original residence, indicating a preference for nearby temporary housing. The built environment emerged as the most critical factor influencing the mobility, followed by family socioeconomic status, while housing costs, surprisingly, having the minimal impact.

We expand upon this conceptualization of historical structural racism by examining the potential associations of probable blockbusting, urban renewal, and proximity to displacement from freeway construction, along with redlining, to multiple contemporary health measures. Analyses linked historical structural racism, measured continuously at the census-tract level using archival data sources, to present-day residents' physical health measures drawn from publicly accessible records for Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Outcome measures included average life expectancy and the percentage of residents reporting hypertension, stroke, coronary heart disease, smoking, insufficient sleep, sedentary behavior, and no health insurance coverage. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine separate and additive associations between structural racism and physical health measures. Redlining, probable blockbusting, and urban renewal were associated with shorter life expectancy and a higher prevalence of cardiovascular conditions, risky health behaviors, and residents lacking health insurance coverage. Probable blockbusting and urban renewal had the most consistent correlations with all 8 health measures, while freeway displacement was not reliably associated with health. Additive models explained a greater proportion of variance in health than any individual structural racism measure alone. Moreover, probable blockbusting and urban renewal accounted for relatively more variance in health compared to redlining, suggesting that research should consider these other measures in addition to redlining. These preliminary correlational findings underscore the importance of considering multiple aspects of historical structural racism in relation to current health inequities and serve as a starting point for additional research.",Author KeywordsHistorical structural racismRedliningBlockbustingUrban renewalNeighborhoodsLife expectancyCardiovascularHealth behaviorsKeywords PlusCONSEQUENCESPOLICIESRISK

However, an oversight in post-occupancy evaluation (POE) impedes the comprehensive understanding of NMIR's impact and post-implementation efficacy. This research addresses this gap by leveraging the lens of place value to examine NMIR's outcomes. Using Wuhan, China, as a case study, 10 Delphi consultations and 28 interviews were conducted among five stakeholder groups: local government, planning professionals, academics, community workers, and residents. Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation (FCE) were combined to identify and rank potential indicators. A total of 6 primary and 22 secondary indicators were identified. The indicators were derived from four key policy areas-health, society, economy, and environment-highlighting the relationship among NMIR initiatives, their contribution to place quality, and alignment with policy goals. AHP and FCE results reveal substantial enhancements in environmental quality, residential properties, and public infrastructure. Nevertheless, the analysis exposes varied satisfaction levels and divergences in the perceived relevance of indicators among the government, professionals, and the residents, particularly concerning social cohesion. These disparities underscore the layered impacts of NMIR. This research recommends integrating resident feedback with expert insights to enhance place quality in NMIR projects by balancing physical upgrades with social considerations. It also advocates for a continuous, adaptable post-occupancy evaluation system to monitor and support place value over time.

The use of collective memory to identify and retain urban identity during urban renewal projects, however, receives less attention than functional and economic investment considerations. This article investigates the importance of urban landscape identity during urban renewal. It postulates that a city's individual and collective memory is important in maintaining its uniqueness in terms of urban landscape identity, but requires economic investment to maintain basic physical comfort and access. A qualitative research approach with photo-elicitation interviews (PEI) was used to investigate the features that activated the memory of the participants and that were important in contributing to the image of Kisumu City, Kenya. There were ongoing and completed urban renewal projects within Kisumu City at the time of the study, which made it a good case study for postcolonial Africa. Twelve residents (as PEI participants), four officials from the County Government, and four professionals were interviewed as key informants. A field investigation was carried out through mapping and photography in addition to an archival review. The study reveals that the old railway station, the port, and the market featured strongly in collective memory as part of historical trade development. Despite the important role of civic and administrative buildings from the colonial era in the formation of memory, place, and identity, there was also a positive response from residents to the 'new look' of the city. The physical upgrade, decongestion and cleaning of the city, its streets and parks as public spaces resulted in greater safety and public use, which was well appreciated from an investment point of view.

Through the conceptual lens of spatio-temporal fix and state entrepreneurialism, and drawing on a field investigation in Beijing, this study presents three key findings. First, the renovation and conversion of diverse property stocks into LRAs exemplify a spatial fix strategy to defer the crisis resulting from excessive capital accumulation in the housing sales market over the past two decades. Second, financialization, as an effective political-economic instrument to promote LRA development, provides a temporary fix for the mounting capitalist crisis but may generate new crises if not properly regulated. Third, market practices of renovation and financialization are closely intertwined with and deeply influenced by state initiatives. This paper not only reveals a novel practice of urban renewal through the development of LRAs, but also advances the theoretical understanding of spatio-temporal fix under state entrepreneurialism.

It is a way to expand and redevelop the city without any forcibly revoking land. In this way, the people do not to be relocated and resettled as in other conventional planning projects, but rather they will be encouraged to contribute their land or the value of their land to the renovation and replanning of the area and modernization of the infrastructure system. Thus, the remaining adapted land area will not only gain in value after its contribution, but also improve and enhance people's living environment and many other profitability. In particular, this approach has been successfully implemented in urban renewal projects in various countries and regions around the world such as Korea, Japan, Germany, India, Nepal and Thailand. The effectiveness of this approach has been demonstrated in minimizing abnormal urban growth in peripheral areas. The implementation of the LPR in the context of Tra Vinh city as a case study on the renovation and replanning of land-use to achieve the sustainable development goals has demonstrated the effectiveness. The results show that the LPR is a powerful policy tool that is not only effective in terms of urban renewal and land-use replanning, but also helps to improve the urban living environment and the life quality of urban residents.

In order to facilitate the optimization of renewal timing and strategy from the perspective of reducing the comprehensive global warming impacts, we put forward the low-carbon bridge renewal decision method referring to the ideas of consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) and dynamic LCA. In the proposed method, a comparative system boundary matching the bridge renewal characteristics is constructed, where the carbon emission reduction owing to the traffic efficiency improvement by functional updating is incorporated as the lowcarbon benefits of renewal, and three types of time-dependent factors, i.e., time-dependent characterization factor, trend factors and changes of traffic demands, are introduced to characterize the influence of renewal timing. The proposed method provided guidance for the renewal of Maogang Bridge, the first long-span cablestayed bridge in Shanghai. Results illustrate that the global warming impacts of renewal construction activities and the low-carbon benefits from functional updating decrease with the renewal timing. For Maogang Bridge, the rapidly increasing traffic demands inevitably advocated renewal in advance, and the reduction of global warming impacts from emission reduction or carbon uptake could be manifested for renewal in advance. Adopting material recycling in the disposal of old bridge helped reconstructing a new bridge while deconstructing the old one in 2019 becoming the finally selected low-carbon renewal strategy, which is expected to reduce 15.04 kt CO2e-2019 compared to the essential renewal in 2050 with the landfill disposal method. The robustness of the strategy choice has been justified, given the variations of analytical time horizon, expected emission trends and repair emissions. In this way, the low-carbon renewal decision method could build a quantitative basis for judging the urgency of functional updating and verifying the low-carbon benefits of immediate concrete recycling in up-coming urban renewals.",Author KeywordsBridge renewalLow -carbon decisionCarbon emissionsEmissions timingMaterial recyclingDynamic life cycle assessmentKeywords PlusTIMEFRAMEWORKIMPACTSCEMENTLCA

In the existing renewal decision-making, few strategies have been formulated with the goal of promoting the lowcarbon development. As a fundamental building block of a city, low-carbon construction in neighborhoods is already the basis for promoting sustainable cities. Therefore, this study develops a carbon accounting methodology and an efficiency assessment model that are applicable at the neighborhood level to measure the carbon emission characteristics and reduction potential. Then, a decision-making framework for sustainable neighborhood renewal is put forward from the perspective of carbon emission mitigation. Through a case study of fifteen communities in Yuzhong District, Chongqing in China, this study reveals the current situation of community CO2 emission and carbon emission efficiency, and formulates the sustainable renewal paths according to local conditions. Results show that 83.16% (1.68E+08 kg) of the CO2 in the study communities comes from energy consumption, and CO2 absorption is only 1.78% (3.62E+06 kg) of the total emission. Meanwhile, the carbon emission efficiency of the fifteen study communities has a significant heterogeneity, with a mean value of 0.7402, and 80% of these communities are ineffective. These communities are ineffective mainly because the resource investment cannot be fully utilized. For example, the average utilization efficiency values for energy, purchased resources, and natural resources are 0.7427, 0.8113, and 0.4384, respectively. Thus, adopting adaptive renewal strategies to integrate the use of resources can effectively promote the construction of low-carbon neighborhoods.

Taking Shenzhen city as a case, we investigate the spatial characteristics and the change of the Shenzhen city urban center system from the dimensions of spatial pattern, center level and function uses. Urban centers are identified based on spatial clustering method with the point of interest (POI) spatial data of the city's maps in 2010, 2015 and 2019. The results show that Shenzhen's urban centers have experienced a rapid growth from 2010 to 2019 and urban center system has been expanded from the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) to non-SEZ areas. A polycentric urban spatial structure had been formed in Shenzhen by the end of 2019, and the spatial distribution of identified urban centers within different levels is consistent with the central place theory. The old urban centers are generally superior than the emerging centers in terms of area scale, centrality level and the proportion of public services. But the degree of difference is decreasing over time. In general, the guidance of urban master plans, the implementation of urban renewal projects and the improvement of traffic conditions have played important roles in the formation and evolution of the urban center system in Shenzhen.

In this context, housing demolition becomes a challenge involving people's livelihood during the process of urban renewal. As a legacy issue, the governance of informal housing is imminent. Small-property-rights housing (SPRH) refers to long-term, large-scale informal housing built on collectively owned land in China. Although Collectively Owned Land Price Assessment Guidance stipulates that SPRH cannot be demolished forcibly without compensation. However, Land Management Law states that compensation standards depend on local governments, resulting in unfair compensation. By integrating the first-difference model (FDM) and the boundary-fixed-effect model into the hedonic pricing model, this study proposes a model of demolition compensation of SPRH based on market value standard, which takes state-owned land compensation standard and residential land floor price into account. Using the case of Nanjing, this study estimates whether Xingdu Garden's demolition compensation deviates from a reasonable level. The results indicate that compensation is reasonable. Residents can take advantage of compensation to purchase affordable housing, and generous subsidies have significantly improved their living standards. FDM can also offer technical support for assessing the rationality of informal housing compensation. These findings, providing a reference for urban renewal and social equity, can be applied to other cities.",Author KeywordsUrban renewalSmall-property-rights housingCollectively owned landMarket value standardDemolition compensationDeviation levelKeywords PlusPROPERTY-RIGHTSPRICESMARKETSETTLEMENTSGOVERNANCESIMULATIONRELOCATIONAMENITIESBIG

The idea of a smart city has arisen as one of the potential solutions to this concern. In this study, we have demonstrated how citizen science helps immensely to the growth of a smart city by crowdsourcing data about urban decay. Tehran, the capital of Iran, which is home to the history of many people's social lives, has begun losing some of its vitality. Municipalities have plans for dealing with urban decline and revival, but we indicate that volunteered geographic information (VGI) would be more effective in turning such ideas into practice. According to our research, there are three different types of organizations active in urban renewal: municipalities, civil and urban planning agencies, and organizations that support tourism and cultural heritage. As a result, we provided a system design that outlines the duties that each institution has in relation to urban renewal. In addition, we suggested a service broker with the capacity to publish VGI in order to offer interoperability related to geographic data and services based on spatial data infrastructure (SDI). Beyond that, various types of urban decay, necessary management procedures, the sequence of information in system components, and the volunteer's behavior confronting the system were all specified in the form of an object-oriented design. A prototype system based on state-of-the-art in open-source technologies was developed to test our hypothesis. The VGI system enabled us to monitor urban decay events in real time using the management dashboard. We have shown that volunteers can distinguish between urban declines and typical instances like a binary classifier in the quality control method proposed in this study. Performance was 90% based on the findings of the quality control.

Yet, when it comes to understanding the role of the built environment, a disproportionate focus on redlining obscures other historical policies and practices such as blockbusting, freeway displacement, and urban renewal that may impact contemporary child development. We hypothesized that historical structural racism in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania's, built environment would be associated with fewer contemporary educational, socioeconomic, and health opportunities. We also hypothesized that these measures would explain more collective variance in children's opportunities than redlining alone.METHODS We used geospatial data from the US Census, Mapping Inequality Project, and other archival sources to construct historical measures of redlining, blockbusting, freeway displacement, and urban renewal in ArcGIS at the census tract level. These were linked with data from the Child Opportunity Index 2.0 to measure children's opportunities across domains of education, socioeconomic status, and health. We ran spatial regression analyses in Stata 18.0 to examine individual and collective associations between structural racism and children's opportunities.RESULTS Historical redlining, blockbusting, and urban renewal were largely associated with fewer contemporary educational, socioeconomic, and health opportunities, and explained up to 47.4% of the variance in children's opportunities. The measures collectively explained more variance in children's opportunities than redlining alone.CONCLUSIONS In support of our hypotheses, novel measures of structural racism were related to present-day differences in children's opportunities.

The concern in urban renewal projects is how to sustain place identity, due to changes. In this study, urban landscape identity is the residents' opinions and perceptions of the special features in terms of the physical, meaning, and function aspects that help them differentiate between places. This article postulates that effective public participation is important in identifying, promoting, and maintaining a city's landscape identity in urban renewal projects. The article aims to propose appropriate strategies to develop and preserve urban landscape identity, with emphasis on public participation. At the time of the study, there were ongoing and completed urban renewal projects within Kisumu City, Kenya. A qualitative approach was adopted through interviews with four officials from County Government as key informants, four professionals as experts, and field investigation through mapping and photography. Archival document analysis was carried out based on documents from County Government. The study reveals that Lake Victoria and its scenery, parks, sociocultural activities at public parks, local foods, social interaction at public Central Square, and government buildings contributed to the city's urban landscape identity. The study concludes that, in order to preserve landscape identity, it should be acknowledged in legislations and policies that guide urban renewal and developments, and in public participation processes. The study proposes amendments to the existing planning regulatory controls to guide the preservation of landscape identity in Kisumu.

Residents, as the primary users of the community, have become a vital component of community micro-renewals. With the advent of participatory design, designers are no longer the dominant constructors of communities. Residents' participation is essential to current community micro-renewals, but the existing resident involvement still reflects a lack of initiative and an underutilization of potential. Instead, co-creation, in which residents can be deeply involved in the community micro-renewals, is becoming the mainstream. This paper categorizes co-creation models in community microrenewals into three types according to the degree of residents' participation: the co-creation model based on common ideation, the co-creation model for resident participation in the design process, and the co-creation model of resident-led community regeneration. Three corresponding cases in Shanghai, China are analyzed in relation to specific scenarios and typologies. Each case study provides a contextualized interpretation of the characteristics associated with different types of co-creation.

The irrational decision of urban renewal led to serious economic waste and environmental unsustainability. In this regard, this study proposes and validates a method for regeneration diagnosis and optimal regeneration of RBs based on circular economy (CE) theory. A hybrid diagnostic tool of life cycle cost (LCC)-life cycle assessment (LCA) model to systematically evaluate the economic and environmental impact of RBs throughout the circular lifecycle was proposed. On this basis, with the minimum average annual economic and environmental impact as the objective function, the optimal dynamic regeneration cycle of RBs is obtained using a multi-objective optimization method. The results of the case study show that: (1) The discount rate and deterioration rate changes the development tendency of economic and environmental data, which brings a new regenerating time point, (2) the economic impact of RBs' regeneration tends to be more pronounced during the intermediate stages, while the environmental impact becomes more significant in the later stages, (3) the environmental benefits of regeneration outweigh the economic benefits, (4) the regeneration of all building elements at the local optimal level leads to enhanced comprehensive benefits compared to multiple regenerations of a single building element.

Collecting subjective evaluation data through questionnaires for model fitting, data analysis and hypothesis testing, and then the mechanism is explored. The results show that there is a hierarchical relationship. Based on social attributes, built environments and crowd activities, emotional intentions are generated through interaction between people and places over time to form sense of place further. Meanwhile, the study confirms that sense of identity and direction are the two most direct and relevant factors. In addition, social attributes have a positive influence on residence time and residence time has no significant influence on sense of place.

Reasonable parking behavior analysis can effectively contribute to traffic demand management and alleviate the contradiction between parking supply and demand. To this end, this paper constructs a multinomial logit model based on Python that considers multiple factors affecting parking. First, to accommodate the multi-day behavioral variability and unobserved heterogeneity in individual characteristics ignored by traditional parking surveys, multi-day stated-preference(SP) and revealed-preference(RP) data collected in Xi'an were used to analyze people's parking choice behavioral characteristics. The questionnaires were designed by SPSS software with orthogonal design principles. Secondly, based on multi-day survey data, parameter estimation and significant factor evaluation of Multinomial logit(MNL) model are completed by using Python. Finally, the effects of parking rates, invehicle time and out-vehicle time on parking choice behavior are explored, and the parking behavior of passengers in different scenarios is also simulated. This paper conducted an empirical experiment in Xi'an. The research results show that in-car time and parking rate are significant factors affecting passengers' parking behavior, indicating that it is feasible to guide travelers' parking behavior and alleviate regional traffic congestion by changing the above factors.

In order to estimate the COVID-2 airborne transmission by aerosols, a real urban bus was simulated by CFD. Twenty passengers (containing the driver) were included in the model with a typical inhalation-exhalation breathing cycle. The concentrations of air exhaled by ten of them were tracked during 30 min using Eulerian scalar tracer, and the concentrations inhaled by the twenty passengers were monitored. Then, the well-known Wells & Riley risk model was applied in order to estimate the cumulative inhaled viruses and the subsequent transmission risk.Four scenarios were considered: HVAC off with closed windows (Case 1), HVAC on with closed windows and 100% of air recirculation (Case 2), HVAC on with closed windows and 75% of air recirculation (Case 3), and HVAC off and the bus moving at 20 km/h with some windows opened (Case 4).

While urban heat island effects have been well documented, few studies identified the LULCC-induced tem-perature disparity within cities and nearby rurual areas. Through an integrated analysis of satellite observations and regional model simulations, this study quantifies LULCC effect on summer temperature in old urban areas (existed in 2003), new urban areas (developed after 2003) and rural areas (non-urban areas) over Eastern China in 2003-2019. The results show that LULCC causes urban areas to become warmer, with the effect being more pronounced in new urban areas than in old urban areas. Air temperature (2 m, T2) and surface temperature (TSK) in new urban areas increase respectively by 1.69 degrees C and 3.40 degrees C, while in old urban areas, T2 (TSK) increases by 0.10 degrees C (0.13 degrees C). Significant vegetation degradation is observed in new urban areas, whereas vegetation restoration occurs in old urban areas in recent years as a result of urban renewal. In contrast, LULCC cools and greens rural areas, with a 0.02 degrees C (0.03 degrees C) decrease in T2 (TSK). Urbanization warming can spread to the suburbs, along with vegetation degradation. The analysis of surface energy budget reveals that the reduction in latent heat plays a dominant role in urban warming. Our study underscores that a much larger greenspace fraction and albedo management in urban areas are suggested as an inherent part of future LULCC policy to alleviate urban-rural temperature disparity.",Author KeywordsUrban warmingVegetation degradationLand use and land cover changeAtmospheric modelingKeywords PlusVEGETATION COVERMODELING SYSTEMLOWER REACHESHEAT-ISLANDURBANIZATIONMODISCLIMATEVALIDATIONREGION

As a concept, cadastral renewal refers to digitising the cadastral plan and correcting errors because of cadastre in the legal land registry information, updating them in a format and structure to create infrastructure for spatial information systems, making them available for use. Before 1987, cadastral work was conducted following various production methods and laws of the period. As a result of rapid urbanisation, the transformation of rural areas into urban areas, and the increase in the value of parcels, the delay in land-related investment projects because cadastral data and technical documents do not meet the expectations of accuracy and completeness, has been discussed for a long time in the country. Cadastral renewal projects carried out in places of urgent need because of technical and legal problems have become state policies with the Land Registry and Cadastre Modernization Project (TKMP), initiated in 2007 using the resources provided by the World Bank. In this project, it was determined that 22.3 million of the existing 58.3 million cadastral parcels in Turkiye should be renewed. As of 2021, approximately 14 million parcels have been renewed by the participation of the private sector while the renewal of the rest has been ongoing.

However, the identification of bottlenecks for emergency vehicle passage on urban streets currently relies on labor-intensive and inefficient on-site manual audits. This study proposes a deep learning-based approach to achieve automatic identification of ambulance passage on urban streets. The Vision Transformer network is utilized to construct the classification model of Impassable Narrow Roads, Passable Narrow Roads, and Wide Roads based on street view images. To train and test the constructed models, a specialized dataset is established, consisting of street view images labeled by experienced ambulance drivers. Comparative experiments are conducted to confirm the optimal structure of the model and the necessity of semantic segmentation preprocessing for street view images. To confirm the superiority of the proposed approach, four commonly used deep learning methods, MobileNet, ShuffleNet, SuperViT and DualViT serve as the baseline tests. Experimental results reveal that the model with four-head and one sequential encoder achieves the highest evaluation accuracy at 75.65% among the proposed models on the original dataset, significantly outperforming benchmark models. Meanwhile, the segmentation of street view images improves accuracy to 77.42%, but it reduces computational efficiency from 0.01 to 3 seconds per image. Finally, the optimal model is applied to the area within the Second Ring Road of Beijing as an example to discuss how the deep learning-based approach proposed in this paper supports urban planning practice and emergency medical response. The proposed approach facilitates the rapid and large-scale identification of bottlenecks in urban streets for ambulances with very limited costs, making a significant contribution to the accurate identification of key areas for urban renewal and street governance efforts. The proposed method can further assist emergency vehicle dispatchers and drivers in identifying accessible routes with greater precision during operations, thereby enabling more timely transportation of patients to medical facilities.",Author KeywordsTransportation planningTraffic environment assessmentEmergency servicesStreet view imagesVision TransformerSemantic segmentationKeywords PlusLOCATION

There are interactions and interdependence among many factors, and complex interactions form a coupled relationship between the factors.

Lack of geographic mapping makes it difficult to interpret the causes of the anomalous scaling characteristics of urban multifractal structures. For the few mappable multifractal structure modeling methods, they model multifractal structures from a global or local perspective that generates inadequate or redundant scaling characteristics.

On the one hand, a decrease in available generational capacity means that planned blackouts, known as load shedding, have increased to record levels over the last few years; on the other, the country has instituted an ambitious agenda to decarbonize its energy infrastructure. These processes have both caused upheaval across the country's cities and raised questions regarding the politics of infrastructural provision and development. This article contributes to these debates by exploring the confluence between infrastructure, urban development, and (geo)politics. In particular, we put concepts from critical infrastructure studies (ruin, renewal) into dialogue with Gramscian traditions of political economy in order to analyze what the ongoing breakdown of South Africa's energy system reveals about shifting power dynamics within the state apparatus. Likewise, we ask whether multi-scalar processes of infrastructural renewal will produce more equitable energy futures. We posit that the energy crisis is creating the pressures and policy space for a considerable reorganization of South Africa's governance, largely taking the form of decentralization wherein large cities attempt to attain significantly more autonomy vis-a-vis the central state. Nevertheless, as the crisis engenders movements and counter-movements, renewal is likely to be a protracted, and contested, process.",Author KeywordsInfrastructureSouth Africaenergydecarbonizationstate transformationKeywords PlusINFRASTRUCTUREELECTRICITYCITY

In this study, four morphological indices as frontal area index (FAI), site coverage (SC), building height (BH) and floor area ratio (FAR) were mapped and analyzed by establishing a refined three-dimensional urban digital model. Then indicator analysis, numerical simulation and LST retrieval were comprehensively used to assess the present outdoor ventilation conditions of Macau. The results showed that Macau's overall spatial morphology was not conducive to ventilation. In hot season, the cool sea breeze was obstructed by high-rise buildings in coastal area of the northern peninsula and difficult to infiltrate into the inner city. In cold season, the high pedestrian level wind speed of urban blocks in coastal areas of southern island was not good for wind protection. In Macau's northern peninsula, three potential wind corridors that connecting several existing open spaces are suggested. In southern island, a clustered urban development mode is proposed to create a wind corridor network. In addition, the existing heat islands in the windward side of wind corridors can be reduced by optimizing land surface. For pedestrian-level ventilation, the wind speed of traditional neighborhoods can be enhanced by reducing site coverage and introducing high-rise buildings during urban renewal. Wind protection methods should be considered in existing coastal urban areas, and low-rise high-density development mode is recommended for coastal new town planning in southern island. This research presents an opportunity to assist urban planners and researchers in developing a comprehensive under-standing of Macau's ventilation condition, and provides theoretical support for planning practices for Macau and cities with comparable conditions.",Author KeywordsWind environmentWind corridorHeat Island effectNumerical simulationFrontal area index (FAI)Keywords PlusLEVEL WIND ENVIRONMENTPEDESTRIAN-LEVELTHERMAL COMFORTURBAN VENTILATIONFIELD-MEASUREMENTSSTREET CANYONHEAT-ISLANDK-EPSILONCITIESSPACES

A weighted bipartite network considering urban land attractiveness was first constructed to analyze the commuting flows between urban units. Then a modified Hungarian algorithm was proposed to obtain the optimal commuting interaction fluxes. By comparing real and optimal interaction fluxes, two types of commuting anomalies were detected. Finally, the machine learning model was used to explore the non-linear relationships between built environment and anomalous commuting patterns. Results show the spatial distribution of areas with significant anomalous interactions and the difference between overload- and underload- related anomalous commuting patterns.

A model of the process of choosing the most effective use case for such an object is proposed. The choice is based on the results of a comparative multi-criteria evaluation of the potential functions that are most preferable for implementation. The criteria and indicators of evaluation criteria that are important in the management of an object of a unique industrial environment are identified.

Residents' support for elevator projects hinges on factors such as design plans, cost-sharing arrangements, and the potential for housing appreciation. Government entities play a pivotal role by providing policy support, creating favorable environments, and offering financial assistance. This research contributes theoretically by constructing a system dynamics model, providing a holistic framework for analyzing complex urban development processes. It also has practical implications for policymakers, property owners, and urban planners. Actionable recommendations emphasize community engagement, fair cost-sharing, architectural integrity, and policy support. In a broader context, this study highlights the dissemination of knowledge-driven solutions in urban infrastructure renewal and underscores the importance of knowledge sharing in urban innovation. It advocates for proactive urban policies that enhance the quality of life in aging communities, promoting inclusive and convenient living environments. By bridging the gap between residents' involvement and government initiatives, this research contributes to knowledge dissemination and the creation of more accessible, sustainable, and innovative urban spaces.",Author KeywordsInnovation strategiesElevator installationAging populationResidential communitiesUrban developmentInclusive citiesKeywords PlusCHALLENGESBUILDINGSIMPACTCHINA

Objectives This study aims to quantify the spatiotemporal pattern of urban growth in Shanghai, China for testing urban growth hypotheses, to identify its driving factors, and to provide insights for sustainable urban planning. Methods We fitted a nonlinear curve to the urbanization pattern, employed landscape expansion indices to quantify the spatiotemporal evolution of urbanization, utilized partial least square regression to differentiate contribution of main socioeconomic driving factors. Results Urbanized land in Shanghai exhibited a logistic growth pattern from 1985 to 2015. The annual growth rate of urban area showed a wave-like pattern and peaked in 2000-2005. Urban growth modes of leapfrog, edge expansion, and infilling were identified, and these patterns alternates in dominance over time. The urbanization process in Shanghai followed the spiraling diffusion-coalescence hypothesis. The net increase of year-end residential population, urban infrastructure investment, and the total investment in fixed assets were the dominant driving factors to urban growth. Conclusion A logistic curve well quantified the temporal pattern of urbanization in Shanghai. Urbanization has slowed down, approaching the plateau of the curve, implying that urban growth driven by population increase and investment should switch to sustainable urban renewal and ecological constructions.

Furthermore, the planning of events is subject to an extensive multi-level governance of actor constellations and interactions. Against this background, in this paper we introduce a multi-level governance phase framework for formats of event-led urban development in order to create a better understanding of the structures and processes involved. For this purpose, we first use regional garden shows as a case study, which are event formats with a focus on small and medium-sized cities in Germany and on the (further) development of urban green spaces.

Using a city-level database of 287 Chinese cities from 2012 to 2018, this paper quantitatively reveals the spatial heterogeneity of land redevelopment among different regions, administrative levels, and city sizes, and analyzes how government and market forces generate such geographic characteristics. The findings reveal that: 1) The national land redevelopment ratio increased from 26.44% in 2012 to 31.95% in 2018, with an average yearly rise of 1%. 2) Eastern cities have the largest land redevelopment scale, while Northeastern cities have the highest proportion of land redevelopment, accounting for about 40%. Despite having the highest amount of land redevelopment, high-level administrative cities and large cities do not have a higher proportion of land redevelopment than other cities. 3) Market mechanism is imperfect and unbalanced.

However, the viability of urban regeneration projects (URP) is largely determined by their investment value. This makes it challenging to promote non- or low-profitable URP in many cases. Lacking sufficient market value, such projects tend to rely heavily on limited public resources, which can be a significant burden on society. To address this issue, it is necessary to establish an appropriate area-wide project portfolio selection approach to comprehensively plan and implement URP. Previous studies have focused on single project scales and failed to consider project interdependencies and the multiple objectives of URP. Therefore, this study develops a multi-objective optimization approach for URP portfolio selection that integrates project interdependencies and multiple objectives into a comprehensive mathematical model. The NSGA-II and the TOPSIS are used to obtain trade-off solutions from the Pareto-optimal set. The approach is utilized to a case of Chongqing, China, showcasing its effectiveness in guiding decision-makers towards an optimal URP portfolio that maximizes sustainable benefits.

This approach is unique because it simultaneously considers two critical dimensions of residents' behavior: travel and activity behaviors. By combining these dimensions, we extract a comprehensive set of characteristics, including travel time, travel flow, origin-destination patterns, activity types, and activity time, which are then aggregated at the regional level (i.e., traffic analysis zone). To process these characteristics, we use latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to extract high-level semantic features from each data type.

Long established in many Western contexts, community gardens were not evident in China until a group of scholar-activists in Shanghai initiated the practice in 2016. Drawing on two flagship community garden cases in that city, we investigate the emergence and development of community gardens and discuss the ways in which they instantiate neither a radical nor a neoliberal political vision. Our observations show that a nonprofit organization-rather than the local citizenry or municipal government-proactively advanced the production of community gardens and the discursive construction of community participation over time. The rationale underlying this practice arises from organizers' framing of the community gardens as an ""experiment of governance innovation"" that dovetails with a broader reorientation of China's urban renewal agenda from demolition and reconstruction toward a people-centered incremental urban regeneration characterized by mass mobilization and social participation. We argue, therefore, that the community garden phenomenon reifies an alternative subjectivity-one that emphasizes the increasing visibility of social organizations as a state ""flanking mechanism"" to achieve extraeconomic objectives in urban governance. We also advance a pluralist understanding of China's urban governance beyond a growth-chasing logic to embrace the increasing complexity of the state ethos and societal instruments at play in and associated with this sphere.",Author KeywordsChinacommunity gardeninterstitial spaceregenerationurban governanceKeywords PlusPUBLIC GREEN SPACENEW-YORKCIVIL-SOCIETYCITIESSTATEGOVERNANCECITYENTREPRENEURIALISMAGRICULTUREGEOGRAPHIES

In the centralised dynamic context for China's urban regeneration, the institutional arrangements and practices of public participation and the evolution processes between them still remain ""black boxes"". This paper aims to clarify the institutionalisation process of public participation in China's urban regeneration. Using the historical institutionalism perspective, this research adapts the institutionalisation framework proposed by Burns and Scapens (2000) to the analysis of participatory governance in China's planning context. It analyses three phases of urban regeneration in Guangzhou and provides corresponding case studies for an in-depth analysis. The findings reveal that the success of public participation in urban regeneration varies across phases, mainly due to the degree of government power sharing and the inclusion of nongovernmental actors in decision-making through genuinely participative interactions. This research develops an institutionalisation analysis framework and notes that the proposed institutionalisation path only partially applies to public participation in China's urban regeneration. The institutionalisation of public participation from the institutional realm to the realm of action in China's regeneration practices departs from hysteresis, which is the opposite of synchronisation in historical institutionalism. The root cause of this inefficient institutionalisation and its separation from practice is the imbalance in the allocation of power resources.

Possible effects on the built environment are identified as urban heat stress, air pollution, extreme weather conditions, etc. As a result, there is an increase in disease and mortality specifically in the cities among the vulnerable citizens such as elderly people and children. Moreover, many cities worldwide are in the evolution of urbanization which leads to increased carbon emissions as well as a demand for more material production and waste. Consequently, the construction industry embodies great potential for reaching the energy and carbon mitigation goals. For regeneration of the built environment, the European directives requires for the renovation of existing building stock as quick as possible. In Flemish context, cities stimulate renovation projects on a systematic and planned basis, by defining 'urban renovation districts' which received special financial facilities and subsidizing. Consequently, there is a growing demand for affordable housing in combination with a shortage of qualitative and energy efficient housing opportunities. In the last decades, there has been an intensive effort to develop different retrofit strategies, but there is a lack of comprehensive approach that delivers innovative technical solutions such as circular and bio-based construction methods as a solution to the increased housing demand of vulnerable people. For this purpose, this study combines the efforts of two initiatives, (1) Interreg Circular Bio-Based Construction Industry (CBCI) and (2) the innovative financial policy instrument of subsidy retention for low-income groups (refers to citizens living in poor quality houses with insufficient economic means & social skills to renovate). The study has the ambition to explore the coherence between technical, economical, legal, social aspects for circular urban retrofit strategies.

We address these voids by integrating the literatures of urban studies and crime and deviance to theorise the linkage between nearby gentrification and disorder policing. Using negative binomial regression models to analyse three years of arrest records from the Washington, DC Metropolitan Police Department, we find that the occurrence of gentrification in nearby block groups is associated with increased order maintenance arrests in the average block group.

Surpassing the limitations of traditional linear research, this study explains the internal relationship among the risk factors of GRIB projects and identifies the risk factors that play a brokerage role and the risk relationship that plays a conductive role, providing a theoretical basis for introducing social network analysis tools into the risk assessment of such complex construction projects.",Author KeywordsIndustrial brownfieldGreen redevelopmentRisk networkSocial network analysisKeywords PlusPROJECTSSYSTEM

Urban regeneration has become an inevitable choice for promoting high-quality urban development in the new era. Historical and cultural districts, with historic buildings as spatial carriers, are microcosms of a city's development and a testimony to the lives of local people. It is necessary to define their development position, role in the city, and functions to revitalize them commercially. The best way to achieve these goals is to clarify consumer preferences and identify the key factors that influence target groups' behavioral preferences in similar shopping areas. Only then will we be able to truly preserve the character and value of heritage districts while promoting their commercial development. This paper focuses on heritage districts. Through a combination of online and offline questionnaires, the authors learned about the current situation of young consumer behavioral preferences for urban commercial revitalization projects. A theory of planned behavior model was then built to empirically analyze the factors influencing consumer behavioral preferences in these projects. Based on the results of our analysis, we propose goals and suggestions for the government, property developers, and citizens involved in revitalization projects to support urban commercial revitalization and promote consumers' consumption intentions. Governments emphasize the importance of culture and give more directions to maintain historical elements. From the perspective of property developers, a business format combining culture and the market is necessary.

The effects of indirect stakeholders in historic urban regeneration",CITIES,JUN 2024,0,"The conflict between public and private interests has become a focal point of contention among various parties in the process of expropriation and relocation for historic urban regeneration. Failures to properly resolve such conflict often lead to impeded urban regeneration and/or loss of cultural values. Although previous studies have analyzed the mediating role of various types of indirect stakeholders in historic urban regeneration, they have not further examined various effects of indirect stakeholders. Inspired by the theories of dependence, deterrence, and agency among stakeholders, this study explains the different effects of indirect stakeholders on the three parties (government, developers, and residents) following the evolutionary game theory. Specifically, replicator dynamics equations are established to simulate the evolution paths of the government, developers, and residents in the tripartite game involving indirect stakeholders through a case study for the historic regeneration of Zhongshan Road in Nanning, China. Modeling parameters are obtained through semi-structured interviews and quantified analyses of policy documents. The results reveal that indirect stakeholders (1) show a positive ally effect benefiting the stability of government strategies, (2) have a negative deterrent effect conducive to the stable evolution of developers, and (3) have an indirect leverage effect on the evolution of residents. Our study makes contributions by (1) designing a new indirect stakeholder mechanism to urban regeneration, and (2) establishing a new analysis framework for the tripartite game in urban regeneration.

Given that state-dominated urban redevelopment is slow and limited, the Chinese government has proposed a pioneering market-oriented approach to drive urban redevelopment in Shenzhen. This study seeks to examine the impacts of market-oriented institutional arrangements on land redevelopment approval duration (LRAD) in China from the perspective of public and private interests. Various institutional arrangements are observed under the institutional change of urban redevelopment in Shenzhen, and they are differed by the nature of the applicants, including the original property owners (old factory owner (OFO)), their representatives (e.g., village committees (VC) and the government agency involved in redevelopment (URB)), and developers (DP, second-hand property owner). A number of hypotheses are developed, and empirical tests are conducted to verify or dismiss our hypotheses with the data in Shenzhen. The empirical findings indicate that (1) The LRAD is the shortest when the applicant is the OFO and the longest if the applicant is the local government officials such as URB. (2) Compared with the URB, the LRAD is shorter if the VC is the applicant. (3) The LRAD is longer for the projects with a larger redevelopment scale and the projects with more dedicated public facilities.

These shortcomings make it challenging to meet the requirements of urban spatial change detection and disaster response and recovery. Therefore, this paper proposes a building change detection method based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect changes in buildings in multi-temporal remote sensing images, which was verified using two remote sensing images before and after the Turkiye earthquake on February 6, 2023. In this method, we improved DenseNet 121 to serve as a key component of the deep learning model, utilizing dense connections between layers to improve feature propagation efficiency and enhance the capture of graphic details. Simultaneously, we designed a novel loss function based on the Tanimoto coefficient to measure the difference between the predicted segmentation map and the live segmentation map. Experimental results show that the proposed building change detection method is effective in detecting building collapse in earthquake disasters, with a quantitative accuracy of F1 score exceeding 70%.

Flint's urban structure is homogenous with repetitive blocks of privatelyowned single-family housing, presenting a barrier for public intervention in vacancy.

Urban water managers, policymakers and researchers, however, have paid little attention to repair and maintenance or to their importance for the operation and renewal of urban water utilities. Using a sociotechnical framework, this paper investigates the maintenance and repair practices of utility officials from two water companies, one in Accra and one in Dar es Salaam. More specifically, through the interplay of four variables, we develop a novel analytical framework inspired by science and technology studies to explain and compare the contingent, place-based maintenance and repair practices that shape urban water supply. These four variables are materialities, discourses, institutional arrangements, and the knowledge of local experts. The two aims of this paper are to explain how the 'everyday' repair and maintenance practices of utility officials shape water supply, and to draw lessons for improving water supply in both cities. Our findings show that repair and maintenance practices are strongly shaped by place-based materialities and contextual knowledge in water supply, but at the same time are contingent on wider national and international relations as reflected in discourses, policies, and the supply of technical and material spare parts.",Author KeywordsRepair and maintenancenon-revenue waterurban infrastructureurban planningSTSAccraDar es SalaamKeywords PlusINFRASTRUCTUREPOLITICSINFORMALITYLILONGWESERVICESACCESSSTATES

However, two aspects of VCA still need improvement for more detailed modeling of urban landscape dynamics. One is the lack of simulation of urban renewal prevalent in megacities. The other is the lack of simulation of vertical urban landscape dynamics at the parcel level. Hence, this study should be the first to propose a comprehensive VCA framework for modeling horizontal and vertical multi-type urban landscape dynamics (HV-MVCA) at the parcel level. The HV-MVCA consists of two modules: a deep learning-based horizontal urban landscape dynamic simulation module and a random forest-based (RF) vertical metrics prediction module. Compared with traditional VCA, the HV-MVCA can obtain the highest simulation accuracy with an enhancement of 1.45%-4.56%. The RF-based fitting model can reasonably interpret the vertical metric as the coefficient of determination and the mean absolute percentage error was 0.88 and 28.93%. By localizing shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), the horizontal and vertical urban landscape dynamics in the future can be simulated under different scenarios. As the multi-scenario simulation results can provide abundant horizontal and vertical information at the parcel level, the proposed HV-MVCA can help achieve a more comprehensive assessment of many urban-related issues with these indicators, such as energy consumption, climate change, and pollution emissions.",Author KeywordsMulti-type urban landscape dynamicsVector-based cellular automataHorizontal and vertical dimensionsShared socioeconomic pathwaysDeep learningKeywords PlusCELLULAR-AUTOMATA MODELSLAND-COVER CHANGESOCIAL MEDIA DATATRANSITION RULESNEURAL-NETWORKSGROWTHNEIGHBORHOODSIMULATIONRESOLUTIONEXPANSION

To better understand the impact of urban green space coverage's spatial pattern on land surface temperature (LST), this study selected three sample areas along the urban-rural gradient in Shanghai. Using LST inversion and resampling methods, LST data for different grid sizes were obtained for spring, summer, and winter in the 2010s, 2015s, and 2020 s. A boosting regression tree model was employed to determine the key indicators affecting LST and effective cooling thresholds. The impact of green quality, structure, and pattern at the community scale on LST was discussed, providing feasible suggestions for green space planning and design in different urban spaces. The study found significant differences in the spatial patterns of green areas and LST among the three sample regions. The quantity and integrity of green spaces in the Huangpu, Minhang, and Songjiang sample areas have progressively improved, with overall green coverages of 19 %, 38 %, and 43 %, respectively. As grid size increases, the relative influence of fractional vegetation coverage (FVC) on LST generally decreases, whereas the relative influence of green structure and patterns gradually increases. Taking the summer of the 2020 s as an example, the influence of FVC on the three study sample areas was 80.79, 83.36, and 87.18 at a 30 m grid size, which decreased to 48.87, 40.59, and 47.64 at a 120 m grid size. The green structure's impact rose from 13.09, 15.22, and 10.6-30.01, 51.82, and 38.5; the influence of green patterns increased from 6.12, 1.42, and 2.21-21.13, 7.6, and 13.86. Key indicators affecting LST include FVC (Fractional Vegetation Coverage), AREA (Green Patch Area), PD (Patch Density), COHESION (Patch Cohesion Index), and ED (Edge Density). High temperatures in summer are one of the ecological issues that need special attention in Shanghai's green space design. Setting the green space proportion to 35 % while avoiding fragmentation and low vegetation coverage can achieve effective cooling. This study's main advancement lies in utilizing machine learning algorithms to identify the principal green spatial pattern impact factors and key thresholds influencing LST at the community scale in Shanghai. The related results and proposed strategies provide a research framework and strong basis for special regulations in urban green space system planning concerning urban thermal environments. They offer references for urban renewal and new town planning to address climate change and urban high-temperature issues, such as clear requirements for optimal green space area at the community scale, community park spatial layout and quantity regulations, and urban park planning design suggestions. This study also highlights obstacles in the practical application of planning and design strategies, which can help avoid difficulties in implementing planning policies.

Investigation of urban sinkholes poses a significant challenge because of the multi-factor's confusion, as well as the spatial uncertainties in susceptibility mapping due to urban renewal frequently. To address these issues, a comprehensive urban sinkhole risk assessment framework was proposed, and Shenzhen city in South China was selected as a case study area, where a lot of sinkholes occurred along with intensive human construction activities in recent years. Initially, the sinkhole susceptibility map was drawn using the grey relation analysis (GRA) method, incorporating the spatial information database of meteorology, geology, metro and pipeline systems, and then both the sinkhole density map and the time-varying land subsidence monitoring database were used to verify the accuracy of the sinkhole susceptibility map. Furthermore, the sinkhole risk assessment map in transportation system was subsequently drawn based on the susceptibility map, where the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and the advanced geophysical exploration technologies were employed to probe the potential sinkholes in critical risk areas. The conclusions reveal that the sinkhole susceptibility map based on GRA method demonstrates a promise in identifying the likelihood of urban sinkholes, and the risk assessment framework can be employed for the prevention and remediation of urban sinkholes, which contributes to an economical and efficient scheme for sinkhole detection, as well as transportation system resilience assessment at a city-wide scale.",Author KeywordsSinkholeSpatial distributionSusceptibility mappingRisk assessmentGrey relation analysisKeywords PlusMANTLED EVAPORITE KARSTGROUND SUBSIDENCEAREAHAZARDMINECITY

Second, its effect on haze pollution was most pronounced in the eastern region, which had the highest urbanization rate. This study also explored the moderating effect of new urbanization and haze pollution from the urban governance perspective. The results show that the government's fiscal spending capacity is significant for new-type urbanization's ability to improve haze pollution. In addition, in the pilot year, the turnover of regional officials enhanced new-type urbanization construction to improve haze pollution. We also find that districts and counties implementing pilot new-type urbanization are conducive to reducing haze pollution in surrounding areas in the same city not implementing new-type urbanization; however, they exacerbate haze pollution in other provincial areas that have not implemented new-type urbanization.

The difference-in-differences (DID) model and spatial difference-in-differences (SDID) model are adopted to analyze the impact of the HSR service intensity on the urban economic resilience. Results imply that the HSR has significantly improved the urban economic resilience along the lines. Further analysis shows that HSR mainly increases the economic resilience through potential effect of human resources, dynamic effect of new economic sectors and vitality effect of innovation output. From a spatial spillover perspective, HSR not only improves the local economic resilience, but also improves that of neighboring cities. The spatial spillover effect of HSR conforms to the law of geographic distance attenuation with spillover coefficient changes. Moreover, the study documents a series of heterogeneity analysis concerning HSR effects across Chinese cities.

The main motivation of this study is to investigate the prevailing oceanographic conditions of Northern Thermaikos Gulf, which are associated with the quality of the semi enclosed basin's water masses. The hydrography and the hydrodynamic circulation patterns are revisited, based on the findings of a multi-platform observational study, conducted during a recent annual cycle, from June 2021 until May 2022. The observational findings are supported by a three-dimensional high-resolution hydro-dynamic model (Deltf3D-Thermaikos) with updated freshwater input from all important land sources. The physical connectivity between the sub-basins of Thermaikos, the renewal of its northern coastal areas and the seawater quality are strongly related to the variability of wind-induced circulation.

The prevailing northerly winds contribute to the southward removal of the polluted sea surface and riverine waters, enhancing the cyclonic circulation around the gulf, allowing the inflow of clearer Aegean Sea Waters along the eastern coasts of the gulf. Northerlies also promote a connectivity pathway between the environmentally stressed Thessaloniki Bay (urban seafront) and the commonly less polluted southeastern coasts of the central basin.

There is an ongoing desire amongst design practitioners and end-users for outcomes that foster biodiversity. However, such outcomes continue to be limited to ad hoc initiatives by individual champions rather than being standard practice. Designers are increasingly asked to integrate nature and biodiversity considerations within design, but what does this mean? We explore the variety of roles for biodiversity that have been assumed in urban development processes over the last two decades, through a systematic review of academic literature. We found that biodiversity was given 'passive', through to 'incidental' and 'active' roles, traditional development practice focuses largely on passive approaches. Discussing the implications of the conscious or unconscious role 'assigned' to biodiversity, we contend that giving biodiversity an 'active' role within design is essential for enabling biodiversity inclusive cities. We propose that acknowledging the 'non-human' stakeholder role of biodiversity is a critical first step towards proactive choices that enable 'biodiversity inclusive design'. This will enable designers to expand user-centred design for a more nuanced understanding of both human and nonhuman needs. We present an emergent 'participatory ladder for non-humans', which encourages designers to elevate biodiversity to having an active stakeholder role, leading towards biodiversity inclusive design practice.",Author KeywordsMultispecies designSocio-ecological resilienceDesign approachEcological designRegenerative designBiodiversity inclusiveKeywords PlusECOSYSTEM SERVICESLANDSCAPE PATTERNCLIMATE-CHANGEDESIGNRESILIENCEECOLOGYSYSTEMSIMPACTCITIESCITY

Mechanism analysis indicates that the inner networks affect household insurance purchase through risk -sharing and the outer networks through information dissemination and learning. Outer networks are of value to screen insurance companies by word-of-mouth. Surprisingly, insurance renewal analysis suggests that inner kinship networks have no persistent impeding effects, while the mutable outer networks persistently complement household insurance consumption.

However, obtaining a holistic spatial-temporal scene representation is difficult because places are often composed of multiple images from different angles, times and locations. This problem also exists in other types of geo-tagged imagery. To solve it, we propose a purely visual, robust, and reliable method for urban function identification at the street scale. We introduce a method based on a two-layer spatially dependent graph neural network structure, which handles sequential street view imagery as input (typically available in services such as Google Street View, Baidu Maps, and Mapillary), with full consideration of the spatial dependencies among road networks. In this paper, we construct an urban topological map network using OpenStreetMap data in Wuhan, China, and compute a semantic representation of the scene as a whole at the street scale using a large-scale pre-trained model. We construct the graph network with streets as nodes based on 28,693 mapping relationships constructed from 75,628 street view images and 5,458 streets. Only 5.3% of the node labels were required to obtain 10 categories of functions for all nodes in the study area.

We also use the model to sense urban spatial-temporal renewal by computing time series street images.

UCSs are crucial for timely tracking of urban expansion and renewal progress, understanding settlement environments and human activities, and achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 and 11. However, distinguishing UCSs from other land covers remains challenging, whether using spatial texture and spectral features or time-series characteristics. There is an urgent need for a universally applicable UCS mapping method at the national scale, a gap that current research has yet to fill. In this study, we proposed a method combining geospatial data with remote sensing data for national UCS mapping under medium spatial resolution. Additionally, we combine the UCS mapping results with SDGSAT-1 GLI data to evaluate the utilization status of new construction areas, thereby supporting SDG 11.3. The results showed that, for six representative cities, the F1-Score and Matthews Correlation Coefficients (MCC) for exposed UCS mapping results ranged from 98.83 % to 99.49 % and from 0.64 to 0.77, respectively. Variable importance detected in the Random Forest (RF) model highlighted that the key to identifying UCSs lay in geospatial information describing UCS spatial distribution, including distance to roads, city boundaries, and dust-proof nets. The assessment of the utilization status for new construction areas highlights the differences in the utilization status with which cities at various stages of development utilize these new areas. We then compared the ability of UCS distribution with existing impervious surface products in reflecting the dynamics of urban construction. The results showed that UCS spatial distribution could reflect urban construction patterns more timely and accurately, providing key insights for urban planners. Overall, this study provides a universal methodology that can be referenced for mapping land covers that have low separability in spectral and textural features in complex urban environments.

Advancements in big data and machine learning have paved the way for the multidimensional evaluation of spatial quality in historic urban areas. In this light, our research proposed a new evaluation system and optimization strategy rooted in the unique attributes and cultural values of these areas. Our empirical research focused on Suzhou Ancient Urban, a representative historic urban area in China. First, we identified six indicators, including appearance, order, atmosphere, and scale, to evaluate the public's perception of the streets in Suzhou Ancient Urban, a place rich with cultural history and local characteristics. This evaluation resulted in a perception map of this area. Second, we explored the unique planning structure, functional distribution, and visual elements of Suzhou Ancient Urban. Using spatial syntax, points of interest (POIs), social media post data processed via natural language processing (SnowNLP), and semantic segmentation methods, we connected the physical attributes of the area with public behavioral preferences and perceptions. This macro-to-micro approach combined subjective and objective evaluations to measure spatial quality. Finally, we established a database for organic urban renewal, which highlights the spatial characteristics of historic urban areas that the public preferred. Our findings indicate that the spaces with higher accessibility in Suzhou Ancient Urban scored better in terms of overall perception. Furthermore, highly distinctive and accessible spaces were the most attractive to the public. Elements such as buildings and walls negatively impacted perception, while infrastructure elements such as roads, pavements, and greenery had a positive effect.

Time-series urban land use (ULU) maps are vital for capturing dynamic land changes in the urbanization process, giving valuable insights into urban development and its environmental consequences. Recent studies have mapped ULU in some cities with a unified model, but ignored the regional differences among cities; and they generated ULU maps year by year, but ignored temporal correlations between years; thus, they could be weak in large-scale and long time-series ULU monitoring. Accordingly, we introduce an temporal-spatial-semantic collaborative (TSS) mapping framework to generating accurate ULU maps with considering regional differences and temporal correlations. Firstly, to support model training, a large-scale ULU sample dataset based on OpenStreetMap (OSM) and Sentinel-2 imagery is automatically constructed, providing a total number of 56,412 samples with a size of 512 x 512 which are divided into six sub-regions in China and used for training different classification models. Then, an urban land use mapping network (ULUNet) is proposed to recognize ULU. This model utilizes a primary and an auxiliary encoder to process noisy OSM samples and can enhance the model's robustness under noisy labels. Finally, taking the temporal correlations of ULU into consideration, the recognized ULU are optimized, whose boundaries are unified by a time-series co-segmentation, and whose categories are modified by a knowledge-data driven method. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we consider all urban areas in China (254,566 km2), and produce a time-series China urban land use dataset (CULU) at a 10-m resolution, spanning from 2016 to 2022, with an overall accuracy of CULU is 82.42%. Through comparison, it can be found that CULU outperforms existing datasets such as EULUC-China and UFZ-31cities in data accuracies, spatial boundaries consistencies and land use transitions logicality.

The findings revealed that Tangshan and Zhangzhou can be classified as high-pressure and low-resilience cities; Lianyungang and Huizhou as highpressure and medium-resilience cities; Dalian and Ningbo as medium-pressure and medium-resilience cities; and Shanghai as a low-pressure and high-resilience city. From 2012 to 2019, the UER of PPCs exhibited a fluctuating upward trend. However, most cities can currently only withstand single petrochemical environmental pressures and are incapable of managing the CEPs of the petrochemical industry. Except for Shanghai, the UER of all cities is below the average level of 0.106. The implementation of cleaner production and the green petrochemical industry's scale have not yet met the policy expectations set by authorities. Moreover, major ecological initiatives and policy regulations are lagging, relative to the pace of the development of petrochemical industries. Key environmental pressure sources from the petrochemical industry were identified: reinforced dependence on petrochemical fuels (0.0393), high carbon emissions from the petrochemical industry (0.0335), and the instability of fossil energy supplies (0.0328). Insufficient environmental resistance (-0.068) and delayed renewal capacity (0.041) have been identified as weak links limiting the UER of PPCs. Strengthening environmental protection projects, improving urban infrastructure, and controlling petrochemical industry risks were projected as common focal points and effective environmental measures for all PPCs to manage long-term threats and sudden CEPs from the petrochemical industry.",Author KeywordsPetrochemical industryCompound environmental pressuresMulti-source data fusionUrban environmental resilienceSustainable citiesKeywords PlusSUSTAINABILITYTHINKING

In order to explore the interactive relationship between urban rail transit and spatial heat map, this study used Baidu heat map and rail transit station ridership data to analyze the coupling characteristics between network centrality, ridership and nearby spatial heat index of rail transit stations on a micro level, taking Shanghai as a case study. Firstly, it investigated the overall coupling relationship between two categories of station attributes and spatial heat through Pearson bivariate correlation analysis. Then, bivariate spatial autocorrelation and geographically weighted regression analysis methods were introduced to explore the spatial association patterns between network centrality and spatial heat, as well as between spatial heat and ridership, followed by a spatial differentiation comparison between the two coupling types. The results show that the coupling relationship between rail network centrality and spatial heat is obviously better than that between ridership and spatial heat at station level, since traffic location advantage can usually develop higher spatial heat, while ridership may be affected by more complex factors. Spatial heat map is more suitable for quantifying the interaction between rail transit and urban space in areas outside the urban core, where increasing rail network centrality has a multiplier effect on spatial heat improvement, but improving spatial heat in areas with low-density development is more conducive to stimulating ridership. It is feasible to evaluate the ridership potential of new stations outside the urban core area by using spatial heat map, but this data alone is not enough to predict ridership. The urban renewal around rail transit stations can be optimized by referring to the differences between the two types of coupling at different spatial locations. This study explored the analytical framework for improving the layout of rail transit network based on urban spatial heat map, and optimizing TOD (Transit-Oriented Development) stations for factors negatively affecting their coupling. It provides a new perspective for measuring the man-land relationship of urban rail transit on the micro level.",geographic information systemsarrow_drop_downland use planningarrow_drop_downpublic transportarrow_drop_downrailwaysarrow_drop_downrapid transit systemsarrow_drop_downregression analysisarrow_drop_downtown and country planningarrow_drop_downtransportationarrow_drop_down

This further affects the water quality and the ability of the rivers to self-purification. A lot of planning and development is required to restore the water quality back to acceptable levels according to national and international standards. This paper describes a critical review on the research on the concept of river restoration for the urban rivers in North London, India and Italy whose waters are a measure of sustainability. These rivers have been polluted and their water quality has deteriorated due to urban development, which necessitates the re-revival and activation of the development potential of these rivers. River restoration is one of the latest concepts of urban rivers' sustainability, as it focuses on planning urban rivers, improving their function and water quality, and restoring them to support healthy and prosperous ecosystems, at various levels. This research will assess the current experiences in pollution treatment through various concepts and techniques in river restoration due to pollution. It will also highlight the strategies and techniques adopted in treating river pollution of the study area to ensure good water quality with the aim to restore the rivers as sustainable rivers. Where the focus will be on the rivers of the city of Basra (northern Iraq) as a study area because these rivers represent the identity of the city, which gave it the title (Venice of Arabs) previously. But at the present time, these rivers have deteriorated due to pollution and have turned into sewage swamps, which requires the development of strategies to restore them. The study concluded that the restoration process of Basra rivers can only be achieved through three concepts that must be applied successively: treating river pollution and improving water quality, restoring rivers, activating the development potential of rivers. Each of these concepts has strategies that must be followed to restore the natural and the aesthetic value of the rivers, and the renewal of society's relationship with nature.

This paper aims to assess provincial NR performance in China by combining the Super-slack-based measure (Super-SBM) model and the Malmquist indices (MI). The study reveals that the NR efficiency in China was not high. The slow movement of frontier shift (FS) and the shortfall in expected social and environmental outputs are likely to be the main reasons for NR inefficiency.

However, the existing research into urban village regeneration does not pay enough attention to the group of rural migrants, and the dynamic process of their participation is indistinct. With a theoretical underpinning of the conception of Arrival City and Affordable City and the ladder theory of participation, this paper attempts to understand the practices of rural migrants' participation in urban village regeneration and, more importantly, to unpack the underlying mysteries of the transition process from arrival cities to affordable cities in China. The paper finds that rural migrants are involved in urban village regeneration indirectly, as opposed to directly or not participating at all. Before a regeneration project take places, they are expelled and ostracised by the alliance of ""government-developer-villager"" because of their informal identities. After the project, middle-class migrants lived in the regenerated urban villages but suffered from social exclusion. Most of the migrants gather in the newer urban villages or form new arrival cities in the urban periphery, resulting in potential social conflicts and a vicious cycle of ""regeneration - migration - regeneration - migra-tion"". The vision is realised only in the environment and discourses from the alliance, but not in terms of rural migrants. China's urban transition from arrival cities to affordable cities is incomplete and one-sided. This transition, guided as it is by the existing mechanism of urban village regeneration, undermines social equity and causes social conflicts, which is not sustainable. These findings and proposed corresponding suggestions can serve as valuable references for the practices of public participation in urban regeneration that are underway in developing countries or where there is eagerness to transition effectively from arrival cities to affordable cities.",Author KeywordsArrival citiesAffordable citiesRural migrantsUrban village regenerationPublic participationChinaKeywords PlusRESIDENTIAL SATISFACTIONENNING ROADREDEVELOPMENTURBANIZATIONDISPLACEMENTMIGRATIONRENEWALGENTRIFICATIONTRANSFORMATIONINTEGRATION

Through a case study of the Kwun Tong Town Centre (KTTC) project, this research investigates whether redevelopment led by the Urban Renewal Authority (URA) in Hong Kong constitutes a form of state-led gentrification. Against the notion of generic gentrification, we argue that an urban process becomes gentrification only when the conceptual assumptions are consistent with contextual realities. Through a literature review, two core assumptions about state-led gentrification were identified: 1) the redevelopment is capital-led and against the community's will, and 2) the logic of capital has overridden the logic of the government during the redevelopment. Despite the appearance of state-led gentrification, the KTTC redevelopment was a state-led while socially-oriented process supported by the local community. This project was undertaken to redress environmental deterioration and building obsolesce in a crowded and old urban area. Government-led planning was necessary because the project required government land, proactive planning, and public subsidies. Local support was conditioned on a societal consensus on the policy governing acquisition and compensation. The scheme design reflected a commitment to social goals and community aspiration. The URA endeavoured to address residents' housing needs by directly engaging residents in the acquisition process. The authority leveraged private-sector capital to take forward redevelopment, but retained control over the project through a plan-led approach and a profit-sharing formula. The negative outcomes of displacement were mitigated by the authority and other contextual factors. The government's ongoing commitment to public housing limited the chance of area-wide gentrification. Whilst not negating the problem of displacement, this article advocates for a grounded perspective to understand the cause and effect of a gentrification-like process. It further calls for research on similar projects to support the development of generalisable counter-gentrification agendas.",Author KeywordsGentrificationState-led gentrificationDisplacementUrban redevelopmentHong KongComparative urbanismKeywords PlusGLOBAL CITYDISPLACEMENTSEGREGATION

In the process of rapid urbanization, the demand for traffic convenience and diversity of public service facilities in rural areas has been further improved. Since the sudden outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, it is more necessary to meet the public service needs of human daily life within a certain space. The huge gap between urban and rural infrastructures, human living conditions, and supporting public services such as education, health, and culture has become a key bottleneck constraining the integration of urban and rural areas. It is appropriate to focus on the requirements for the construction of daily life circles and prioritize the satisfaction of villagers' increasing demand for public services in regions characterized by high levels of urban-rural integration. The behavior preference of public service facilities significantly affects the choice of residential areas. The existing research on village layout optimization focused on the spatial pattern, landscape morphology, influencing factors, and other contents. To some extent, the preference for equalization of public services in the context of urban-rural integration has been ignored. Uneven distribution and low utilization of public service facilities in villages resulted in an inability to adapt spatially and functionally in response to the renewal of urban-rural relations. Taking a highly developed urban and rural integration area named Wuxi City of Jiangsu Province in China as an example, this paper combines the current situation of public service facility allocation and the transport situation of residents in rural areas to build a life-circle system of different levels. On this basis, combined with the optimization goal of public service facilities and the constraints of agglomeration coverage, we try to determine the village layout optimization scheme under the construction of both the daily life circle and location-allocation model.

The research scale was zoned with environmental functional regions, where land management policies were formulated. A case study in Anji County successfully demonstrated the applica-tion of the ESP-MS-PLUS model. First, we constructed three different levels of ESPs as ecological constraints by utiliz-ing ecosystem services evaluation and circuit theory. Second, four scenarios of land use and land cover changes (LUCCs) in 2034 were assumed, namely business as usual (BAU), priority given to urban development (PUD), priority given to ecological protection (PEP), and balanced urban development and ecological protection (BUE). Then, the basic ecological constraints (ecological red line areas and waters) and three types of ESPs were coupled with the four scenarios. The results of the simulation and analysis of landscape metrics under each scenario showed that the PEP and BUE scenarios would effectively reduce the degree and speed of ecological destruction. In addition, there were three environmental functional areas that could be used as priority areas for urban construction to ensure economic development.

However, the current research primarily concentrates on the internal environment of the store and customer satisfaction, while the impact of some environmental features of the outer space of the business district on visitors is seldom systematically discussed. This study takes four commercial districts in Shenzhen as examples, and the streets were categorized into five types based on street characteristics using the cluster analysis method. The relationship between each type of street and the population distribution in the region was subsequently discussed. To this end, a holistic approach was adopted, integrating multi-source urban data such as street view panorama, points of interest (POI), and street and building vectors to describe the built environment. Furthermore, the distribution of people at different times, based on location-based services (LBS) data, was combined to establish statistical models of various streets in commercial districts and evaluate the relationship between street characteristics and human activities. The results demonstrate that the relationship between population distribution and spatial characteristics is different in the five types of streets. Different types of streets have their own advantages, and human activities in the business district are often not affected by this advantage, but by other characteristics. The impact of these factors varies significantly between weekdays and weekends. By systematically categorizing street types and assessing the impact of environmental factors on pedestrian flow, this study sheds new light on the renewal and development of urban commercial districts in the future.",Author KeywordsBuilt environmenthuman activitycommercial areacluster analysismulti-source urban dataKeywords PlusTRAVELATTRACTIVENESSENVIRONMENTPEDESTRIANSSEOULMALL

Observations from New York State,URBAN AFFAIRS REVIEW,JAN 2024,1,"Local governments view land banks as an improvement to the municipal management of foreclosed property. Critics contend that land banks wield too much power, concentrate demolitions in poor and majority neighborhoods of color, and have unfortunate parallels to the flawed, top-down policies of mid-twentieth century urban renewal. Examining land banks through a lens of social equity and reparative planning, this research asks ""To what extent do land banks in New York state work toward equitable urban development?"" Interviews with land-bank leaders, property acquisition and disposition data, and spatial analysis of neighborhood dynamics were triangulated in a comparative case study of three land banks in New York state communities. Although land-bank leaders show an awareness and desire to address issues of equity, the authors observed that more community engagement, expanding partnerships with nonprofits, and shifts in approaches to demolition could provide more equitable outcomes in disinvested communities. Some land banks had clearly adopted policies aimed to acknowledge and address the role land banks can and should play in addressing historical inequities. Whether that commitment to equity will remain strong into the future remains an open question. In a COVID-19 context, land banks were operating with significantly reduced inventories and resources. More resources could be provided to land banks from Federal and State sources to support equity initiatives. But those resources should be provided under the condition that land banks become vehicles for repairing past White supremacist and structurally racist policies that created the uneven landscapes that land banks were created to address.",Author Keywordsland banksvacant propertysocial equitydemolitionreparative planningKeywords PlusCOMMUNITY

Current methods attempt to overcome this by integrating additional sensors, such as cameras, which increases cost and complexity. This paper proposes a novel LiDAR-based mobile mapping framework using global principal planes (GPPs) to address this challenge without additional sensors. GPPs are defined as unlimited planes characterized by principal normal vectors (PNVs). GPPs can provide stronger constraints than traditional small planes extracted from one or certain LiDAR frames because they are little affected by the accumulative error from point cloud matching. A PNV estimation method is also proposed based on an inertial measurement unit and polar histogram, and PNVs are axes of the natural cartesian XYZ coordinate system. Point clouds are transformed into the PNVs coordinate system to extract robust edge and plane feature points and GPPs. The proposed framework is tested in various environments. It achieves about 3 cm accuracy in corridors and similar accuracy in stairwells. Compared to five state-of-the-art mapping methods (Cartographer, etc.), its accuracy improves by over 76%, increasing at least an order of magnitude. In the outdoor KITTI dataset, it shows a reduction in absolute pose errors by 4% to 20%. Extensive experiments demonstrate its accuracy, robustness, and generalizability.

This suggests that the outdoor pedestrian space design does not attract crowds to wander around and stroll. The overall centrality of the space was relatively high, and the spatial accessibility was good. The walking route provided a wide field of vision, stimulating people's desire for exploration. The space is highly guided, and people can visit according to the designed route. There is a big difference in the spatial aggregation and dispersion of POI facilities. Transportation, sports, and leisure facilities are the most evenly distributed, while shopping and life service street facilities vary considerably. During holidays, the intensity and duration of crowd activities are the largest, followed by working days and weekends. The people in the block mainly gather in the western and southern commercial complexes, and the attractiveness of outdoor pedestrian streets is lower than that of commercial complexes. Node space B has pedestrian streets with varying spatial interfaces and inconsistent visual appeal. The results can be used to support the spatial form and structural renewal design of commercial pedestrian blocks. The methods presented in this study provide a quantitative approach for the spatial analysis of other functional areas in the city.",Author KeywordsIsovist-APPPOIheat mapcommercial pedestrian districtspatial form and structureKeywords PlusSPACE SYNTAXURBAN SPACECOMPLEXITYSET

However, whether the urban environment promoted vegetation growth is still un-certain. Using the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), an economic powerhouse of modern China, as a case study, this paper investigated the impact of urban environment on vegetation growth at three scales: cities, sub-cities (rural-urban gra-dient)-pixels. Based on the satellite observations of vegetation growth indicated during 2000-2020, we explored the direct (replacement of original land by impervious surfaces) and indirect impact (e.g., climatic environment) of urban-ization on vegetation growth and their trends with urbanization level. We found that significant greening accounted for 43.18 %, and significant browning accounted for 3.60 % of the pixels in the YRD. Urban area was turning green faster than suburban area. Moreover, land use change intensity (D) was a representation of the direct impact (omega d) of urbanization. The direct impact of urbanization on vegetation growth was positively correlated with the intensity of land use change. Furthermore, vegetation growth enhancement due to indirect impact (omega i) occurred in 31.71 %, 43.90 % and 41.46 % of the YRD cities in 2000, 2010 and 2020. And vegetation enhancement occurred in 94.12 % of highly urbanized cities in 2020, while in medium and low urbanization cities, the averaged indirect impact was near zero or even negative, proving that vegetation growth enhancement was modulated by urban development status. Also, the growth offset (tau) was most pronounced in high urbanization cities (4.92 %), but there was no growth com-pensation in medium urbanization cities (-4.48 %) and low urbanization cities (-57.47 %). When urbanization intensity reached a threshold value of 50 % in highly urbanized cities, the growth offset (tau) tended to saturate and re-mained unchanged. Our findings have important implications for understanding the vegetation response to continuing urbanization process and future climate change.",Author KeywordsVegetation growthUrban -rural differenceLand use change intensityUrbanizationThe Yangtze River DeltaKeywords PlusCHINAEARTHTRENDURBANIZATIONMETHODOLOGYSERVICESCOVERAGE

Drawing on discourse analysis in conjunction with historical-institutional analysis of housing policy trajectories and the place of housing within political-economic change, it shows how territorial stigmatization can be understood as the product of media, policy and social scientific discourses which problematize public housing as well as histories of policy reform and political-economic restructuring which shape its social, material and institutional conditions. The discursive problematization of public housing estates in particular works to obscure the role of restructuring and reform and thus present demolition and redevelopment as a 'common sense' response, even as a form of destigmatization.

Previous studies seldom consider the relationships between spatial patterns and equity for the heterogeneity of built-up residential types in the city, not to mention how to place the pragmatic design strategies to explore green injustice for vulnerable neighborhoods. To address this gap, our study adopts a cascade of three methodological stages: 1) applying an urban morphological spatial pattern analysis (MSPA) to compare urban UGS patterns and the UGS-adapted Gini coefficient to measure the spatial equity of UGS distributions in three local built-up areas, 2) employing the minimum cumulative resistance (MCR) model to determine the location of the newly added UGSs and adopting the 'just green enough' strategy into the redistribution of UGSs for the marginal neighborhood and at the same time to avoid inequality associated with green gentrification, and 3) exploring an integrated design and implementation method for the newly added UGSs that can accommodate both normal conditions and the possibility of future pandemics. The results indicate that there is a strong correlation between socioeconomic status and the distributional justice of UGSs among built-up types, while disadvantaged people living in the densest residential neighborhoods have lower UGS provisions. This paper demonstrates a multifunctional and pragmatic approach for realizing multiscale UGS optimization by exploring it at the subdivision and neighborhood scales. This implication can also help guide decision-makers and planners to understand the complex interplay between social vulnerabilities, gentrification, and urban greening, thus formulating effective policies and hands-on strategies to address green injustice that are not only crucial for this study region but also of great significance for developing countries in the Global South.",Author KeywordsSustainable developmentConnectivityMorphological spatial patternsGini coefficientPandemicsKeywords PlusENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICESPATIAL-PATTERNEQUITYPARKSACCESSIBILITYCONNECTIVITYHEALTHCITIESREGIONINFRASTRUCTURE

Controlling for several city attributes, we examine whether LEZ cities are less congested before and after the pandemic in comparison to non-LEZ cities. LEZs may have been more effective in reducing congestion after the pandemic because the fleet renewal process has slowed down or, alternatively, LEZs may be a proxy of unobservable factors related with attitudes of governments and citizens toward a sustainable mobility. Our results validate the traffic-mitigating role of the LEZ after the Covid-19 pandemic, although such result only holds for the pioneering LEZ cities. Hence, the traffic-mitigating role of the LEZ after the Covid-19 pandemic seems to be related to unobservable attributes that influenced the early decision to implement a LEZ.

The concept itself remains ambiguous, however, which is hampering the pursuit of densification as a strategic land policy objective. In this paper we construct literature-based land policy conflict profiles for different types of densification in order to reach a more nuanced understanding of the complexities involved in promoting densification through land policy. To that end we use a hermeneutic approach to critically review the literature and develop a typology of different densification types with relevance to land policy and categorize land policy conflicts specific to each type. As a result, we distinguish four densification-type-specific land policy conflict profiles: 1) policy-driven large-scale brownfield development, 2) policy-driven large-scale densification of strategic areas, 3) owner-driven medium-scale densification of individual high-rise sites, and 4) owner-driven incremental-scale densification of low-rise sites. The land policy conflict profiles address factors hindering the efficiency and effectiveness of the policy, the allocative, distributive, and procedural justice of densification, and conflicting policy outcomes. These unique conflict profiles allow for a detailed recognition of gaps, weaknesses, contradictions, justice and/or political indecisiveness in land policies promoting densification. The paper con-tributes to a deeper understanding of the challenges faced by land policy aimed at promoting densification. In addition, the conflict profiles will be helpful for practitioners in drafting municipal densification strategies.",Author KeywordsLand policyDensificationConflict of interestLegitimacyKeywords PlusURBANINFILLMANAGEMENTINVOLVEMENTSTRATEGIESPOLITICSRENEWALFUTUREDUTCH

Public bus transport in large urban agglomerations is one of the main sources of pollution. To reduce the generation of pollution, electrification of the bus fleet is considered as one of the potential solutions. The authors developed three models of buses with different power units: diesel bus, diesel hybrid bus, and electric bus. The impacts of model buses were analysed at the stage of their production and operation in the city, as well as the impact of diesel fuel and electricity production. Furthermore, a case study was conducted based on the example of the Polish city of Krakow, demonstrating three possible scenarios for the electrification of the urban bus fleet. Moreover, an analysis of the environmental impact of the current and future Polish national energy production system until 2040 was carried out. Using the IMPACT 2002+ Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) method, the results were reported in four damage endpoint categories: human health, ecosystem quality, climate change, and resources. It was shown that increasing the share of electric buses in urban fleets can be highly beneficial in all four categories if the electricity used to power the electric buses is produced from enough low-and zero-emission energy sources. In addition, the level of environmental burden generated by the different phases of the life cycle of the bus was characterised.

These practices, in addition to being transgressive, tend to be attractive to promoters (public and private) of cities that increasingly vie for a global space, where a niche is frequently gained through cultural policies.The article seeks to elucidate the problematic relationship between the countercultural activities carried out by squatted centers with processes of urban regeneration and gentrification. For this, we will make a theoretical review, as well as a review of empirical cases. In this context, numerous cases illustrate that squatted spaces have been co-opted for gentrifying dynamics.The result, however, indicates that the relationship between the activities of squatted spaces and gentrification is ambivalent and it varies according to each situation.",Author KeywordsSocial movementsgentrificationurban conflictcountercultureurban renewalAuthor KeywordsMovimientos socialesgentrificaciónconflicto urbanocontraculturarenovación urbana

Our research focuses on the years 2013-2018, when state planners and officials began working with PR agents to promulgate state-generated, pro-growth representations of plans through mainstream media outlets. We focus on coverage of three types of large-scale plans, all of which involve complex and varied knowledge contents: city master plans, new neighborhood plans, and urban renewal plans. Using critical discourse analysis and semi-structured interviews with key planners and journalists, we examined what kinds of knowledge and information about these plans were conveyed, and how. We found that a significant percentage (some 40%) of the articles published during this period were based directly on state- issued press releases, and exclusively conveyed state-sanctioned perspectives. We interpret this as an attempt by the state to highlight its own role in planning and housing, while taking advantage of journalists' lack of planning knowledge and pressure to publish in order to construct 'citizen-technocrats' whose knowledge mirrors that of state-affiliated actors. We situate these findings within the emerging academic discourse on ""technocratic populism,"" a form of governance in which populist regimes communicate technocratic knowledge directly to citizens, and show how mis/disinformation tactics usually associated with populist discourse now appear in planning communications in Israel. This practice, we argue, has served to entrench a shift toward a centralized form of neoliberalism, while promoting illiberal conceptions of state-citizen relations in the planning context.",Keywords PlusPOLITICSDISCOURSEDEMOCRACYTRANSPARENCYGOVERNMENTOBJECTIONSNEWS

Evidence from Nanjing, China",LOCAL ENVIRONMENT,DEC 2024,0,"Most studies have measured the distributional equity of outdoor physical activity facilities (OPAFs) considering the unified accessible quantity and ignored the disparity of group availability. This study adopts a multidimensional approach to measure the distributional equity of OPAFs from the levels of city and residential units. Considering the old city of Nanjing as a sample, we first categorised the existing OPAFs into equipped sites, multifunctional sites, and trails and quantified the size and composition of three age groups in each residential unit. Second, we modularised OPAFs' services through which each service type corresponds to one physical activity (PA) module and identified each module's available groups. Third, we adopted accessibility, diversity, and supply-demand structure consistency (SDSC) to measure the distributional equity of OPAFs at two levels. The results showed that at the city level, the gap in the diversity of the modules between Group C (60 years old and above) and Groups A (15-59 years old) and B (60 years old and above) was more significant than that of accessible quantity, while the mean SDSC for Group C was much higher than those for Groups A and B. At the unit level, the differences in OPAFs' group availability generated more significant differences in distributing diversity and SDSC than in the distribution of accessibility. Compared to traditional assessments, this tool integrates the disparity of OPAFs' availability among different groups into the equity measurement, which can enhance the analytical precision and granularity and provide tailored OPAF optimisation strategies.",Author KeywordsAccessibilityequityhigh densityphysical activitypublic service facilityurban renewalKeywords PlusURBAN GREEN-SPACEENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICEPARK PROXIMITYPEOPLEHEALTHINTERVENTIONSASSOCIATIONSRESIDENTSQUALITYDESIGN

This study evaluates the disincentive, incentive, and net effects of environmental restrictions on green technology innovation using a bilateral stochastic frontier model for 115 resource-based prefecture-level cities in China from 2010 to 2019. The findings reveal that: (1) Green technology innovation in resource-based cities is subject to both innovation incentives and cost inhibiting effects of environmental regulations. The disincentive effect of environmental regulation in resource-based cities is 28.63%, the incentive effect is 23.83%, and the net effect is -4.8 %.

However, previous studies on this topic mainly examined the unidirectional impact of NTU on carbon emissions, while disregarding their potential relationship. This study establishes an evaluation system for measuring NTU and explores the bidirectional impact between NTU and total carbon emissions (TCE), per capita carbon emissions (PCE), and carbon emission intensity (CEI). The Yangtze River Economic Belt of China is selected as the study area, and the period from 2005 to 2019 is studied. The results show that: (1) The NTU levels in the upstream, midstream, and downstream regions of the Yangtze River increase from 0.148, 0.208, and 0.365 in 2005 to 0.465, 0.503, and 0.675 in 2019, suggesting that NTU levels tend to be balanced in these three reaches. (2) A positive bidirectional impact is found between NTU and TCE, as well as PCE in midstream and upstream regions, whereas in downstream regions, only a positive unidirectional effect of NTU on TCE and PCE is found. (3) Specifically, TCE plays the most significant role in promoting NTU in upstream regions, while NTU exerts the greatest pulling force on TCE and PCE in midstream regions. (4) Unlike the positive impact between NTU and TCE or PCE, there is a significant two-way inhibitory effect between NTU and CEI. (5) A three-step carbon emission reduction law is found in the process of NTU, where NTU towards low carbon development will experience NTU inhibits CEI, PCE, and TCE in sequential order. These findings provide an important reference for promoting a harmonious relationship between NTU and carbon emission reduction, helping governments formulate reasonable measures to achieve high-quality urban development and carbon emission reduction goals.",Author KeywordsNew -type urbanizationCarbon emissionsGranger causality testFully modified ordinary least squareYangtze River economic beltKeywords PlusRENEWABLE ENERGY-CONSUMPTIONNATURAL-GAS CONSUMPTIONCO2 EMISSIONSURBAN AGGLOMERATIONDIOXIDE EMISSIONSQUALITYIMPACTGROWTHDELTAINDUSTRIALIZATION

To characterize urban development at an accurate spatiotemporal scale, a change detection model is not only required to provide accurate location (Where) and time (When) of the changes, but also semantic information on the change types (What). Accordingly, this study proposed a deep learning method for temporal semantic segmentation change detection (TSSCD) that obtains information on the where, when, and what of changes simultaneously. TSSCD model bridges the semantic gap between remote sensing time series abrupt changes and land cover changes by learning the month-to-month mapping from spectral information to land cover types. We implemented a temporal semantic segmentation model based on the most classic fully convolutional network, where all two-dimensional convolutions and pooling operations were replaced with one-dimensional. We conducted tests on the TSSCD in several urban study areas, and it consistently exhibited good accuracy. In most cases, it outperformed the BFAST and CCDC algorithms, except when only a single spectral band was used. Simultaneously, we analyzed the minimum data requirements for training a TSSCD. The TSSCD currently faces challenges in achieving strong generalization beyond the training data distribution. Additionally, we observed that change detection for specific land cover types can be achieved through the flexible configuration of TSSCD. Finally, we explored a method for constructing datasets using existing products to minimize data annotation efforts, yielding promising results. However, there is still some gap compared to complete manual annotation.

By analyzing the utilization efficiency of energy, water, and land, we established a comprehensive natural resource utilization efficiency index (NRUEI). We then calculated the 2016 index for 165 cities in China, and investigated what caused it to vary. We found three main results: (1) the NRUEI varied greatly across China and there were significant positive correlations between urban energy utilization efficiency (EUE), water utilization efficiency (WUE) and land utilization efficiency (LUE); (2) the NRUEI showed a significant positive correlation with a city's population size, economy (Gross Domestic Product (GDP)), and the level of urban social development (GDP per capita); (3) cities in East China have the highest natural resource utilization efficiency, while cities in Northeast China have the lowest. These results indicate that China's increasing urban development is associated with rising natural resource utilization efficiency and that the city's endowment of natural resources is an important factor affecting that efficiency. Further, the results showed that the determinants of a city's NRUEI differed in large and small cities. Lastly, our results suggest that improving EUE is key for improving NRUEI in urban China, and different efficiencies can be improved intertwined. A major takeaway of this study is that there is great potential for improving natural resource utilization efficiency in Chinese cities and we include city-specific suggestions for efficiency improvements.

On one hand, due to economic constraints in the past few decades, the construction standards of such heritage buildings were relatively low. The living conditions no longer meet the needs of current local residents. The residents' desire for improved living conditions clashes with the imperative to preserve the material remnants, placing them in a dilemma between preservation and transformation. On the other hand, as a result of economic development and urban expansion, the economic location of residential heritage has undergone significant changes. The low-density development pattern is in contradiction with the economic location of the high land price, leading to strong pressures for renovation and renewal. Residential heritages are not easily categorized as landmark heritage projects imbued with specific political or cultural significance.

Block-level change detection with high tem-poral resolution image data provides fine detail of urban changes, is suitable for urban management, and has gradually received widespread attention. High-dimensional features are required to express the heterogeneous structure of the blocks. High-dimensional high-frequency time series, namely, multivariate time series, are formed by arranging high-dimensional features chronologically. Classic change detection methods treat multi-variate time series as univariate time series one by one. Few studies have analyzed the change in a multivariate time series by considering all variables as an entirety. Therefore, a graph-based segmentation for multivariate time series algorithm (MTS-GS) is proposed in this paper. Specifically, 1) we construct a similarity matrix to explore the changing patterns of multivariate time series for seasonal change, trend change, abrupt change, and noise disturbance; 2) a multivariate time series graph is defined based on the changing patterns; and 3) the corresponding graph segmentation algorithm is proposed in the paper to detect the abrupt and trend changes under noise and seasonal disturbances.

It explores the extent of telework adoption across industrial sectors, as well as the long-term impacts of large-scale adoption of teleworking on urban travel demand and the dwindling demand for commercial real estate in downtowns. Design/methodology/approach Using data from a survey of business establishments, this study employs data visualization techniques to illustrate how telework adoption evolved during the early stages of the COVID-19 lockdown. The study also estimates Logit models to explore the determinants of telework before and during the pandemic using a subsample from the Canadian labor force survey. Findings The study found that telework adoption reached a peak in March and April of 2020 when almost 40% of the workers in Canada were teleworking. Only 12% of employees reported teleworking before the pandemic. The adoption of teleworking was far more pronounced amongst firms that use information and communication technologies (ICTs) extensively. Teleworking appears to be far more frequent among university-educated (knowledge economy) workers. Practical implications Knowledge economy and highly educated workers, who switched to teleworking during the pandemic at higher rates than workers with less education, are more frequently employed in offices located in the urban core or downtowns. The drastic decline in commuting to the urban core via public transit and record low occupancy levels in downtown office towers suggests that, even if telework prevailed at levels much lower than those observed during March and April of 2020, landlords holding large portfolios of commercial real estate must prepare to cope with the lower demand for commercial real estate. This is especially significant when commercial leases come up for renewal in the next few years. In addition, governments struggling to address traffic congestion by spending hundreds of billions of dollars on transport and transit infrastructure might want to promote teleworking as a means of reducing travel demands and costly infrastructure expenditures. Social implications Teleworking has partially eroded the boundaries between work and home by enabling millions to continue being productive while working from home. However, teleworking would require new norms and rules to maintain a work-life balance. This change requires workers and employers to cooperate.

A similar logic seems to drive the choice of locations for affordable housing developments in Brazil. This article intends to present evidence which confirm this statement, using data and location analysis (including density mapping) of affordable housing developments in Brazil within the Minha Casa Minha Vida Program between 2009 and 2020. Among 17,393 locations analysed, 8,216 (or 47%) are less than 1,500 meters from at least two other developments financed by the same program. The national average is 4.25 similar developments (with an average of 190 housing units each) within the studied radius of 1,500 meters. Even in metropolises and cities with more than one million inhabitants, where distances and developments are greater (231 housing units each on average), clusters average remains above 4 (in 4.11). This preference for proximity to other developments seems to be related to the need for greater visibility to optimize sales, to the search for economic efficiency in the execution of construction and to the herd behaviour of private agents.",Author Keywordsaffordable housingmassive housing productionreal estate marketMinha Casa Minha Vida

We find that between 1913 and 2013, Bridgeport lost nearly 1.9 million square feet of taxed effective square feet to interstate construction and devoted another roughly 2.2 million square feet to surface parking. Using 2013 tax rates, we find that property tax revenue shrank to just over a quarter of 1913 levels, from a projected $19 million (in 2013 dollars) in 1913 to $5 million in 2013. Land use also became less diverse and more concentrated, dominated by large commercial and tax-exempt parcels. The concentration and lower tax revenue reduced the resilience of downtown. This paper provides a new method to estimate the effects of highway construction and develop predictions for the effects of highway removal. We estimate that $3 million in tax revenue could be restored by highway removal, and a further $2 million by building housing on surface parking lots, doubling the current tax base. Increasing residential uses downtown would be particularly useful in restoring the diversity of uses, supporting neighborhood retail, and providing citizen advocates for downtown.",Author KeywordsUrban renewalfiscal healthhighway constructionhighway removalhistorical GISKeywords PlusPARKINGCITY

Lecture Notes in Civil Engineering (393),2024,0,"With the aim to promote carbon-neutral urban development, a number of recent pilot studies and building projects have investigated an innovative building retrofit solution: modular facade retrofit systems that combine photovoltaics products. Due to the novelty of this field, there is a limited systematic investigation of this promising solution. To present the state-of-the-art of this solution and to investigate future promotion needs, this study conducted a systematic literature study. Out of more than 200 relevant articles, 16 closely related papers were selected for in-depth review. Based on the review, the author proposed a definition of modular facade retrofit with integrated photovoltaics (MFRIPV) and summarized the current key focuses of MFRIPV, including energy performance and economic feasibility, system composition, and design process. The PV technologies and modular structural types of representative MFRIPV cases were also categorized. The findings showed that MFRIPV has satisfactory payback time and can be adopted in both residential and office buildings, providing multifunctional improvements such as better energy efficiency, interior daylight quality, solar energy harvesting and even vertical food production. To further promote MFRIPV application, the author suggested that aesthetic guidelines, integrated energy storage system, and design and management from a life-cycle perspective could be the next investigation priorities. The ultimate goal of MFRIPV should be ""energy efficient, energy productive, aesthetically pleasing, user-centered design, easy for massive modular manufacture and assembling, easy for maintenance and upgrade, cost-effective''. This study provided a foundation for advanced MFRIPV study and could serve as a reference for architects, building engineers, researchers, and policy-makers working in the field of sustainable urban renewal.",

In the current Chinese context, the NR is mostly dependent on governmental planning and funding. But due to the limitation of time and resources, it is impossible for the government to propose and dominate NR in every single dilapidated neighborhood. Therefore, promoting resident-initiated NR projects is an essential strategy for improving citizens' wellbeing and meeting the requirements of sustainability. However, in the dilapidated neighborhoods, the residents' cooperation in NR is not simply relied on their discourse power. Their choices of responses may be strongly influenced by various factors. Nevertheless, there have been few studies that examined the residents' choices of responses in NR. By adopting the ""exit, voice, loyalty, and neglect (EVLN)"" framework, this research aims to investigate how the relevant elements, including the perceived impact of NR, social capital, neighborhood environment, and residents' dependency, can influence residents' choice of responses. Two old neighborhoods in Shanghai were selected as the case study area. The data is collected through a questionnaire survey. The principal component analysis and multiple regression techniques are utilized to unveil the mask of their intrinsic relationship. The empirical results suggest how the above elements have impacted the residents' responses to NR to a certain extent. Notably, several key findings were revealed from the results. The residents with high-level dependency, perceived high-level social capital, and strong impact of NR are more likely to choose voice response. The lowlevel dependency, perceived poor neighborhood quality, and low social capital lead to the residents' exit choice. And the response of loyalty/neglect is due to the perceived good living environment, low-level social capital, and the ignorance of NR impact on their lives. Finally, some policy implications were drawn to promote the residents' active and positive action in initiating NR projects in their dilapidated neighborhoods.",Author KeywordsNeighborhood regenerationResident-initiatedEVLN frameworkBehavioral responseKeywords PlusSOCIAL IMPACT ASSESSMENTDECISION-MAKINGPUBLIC-PARTICIPATIONCITIZEN RESPONSESPOLITICAL-ACTIONRENEWALDISSATISFACTIONSATISFACTIONMOBILITYSUSTAINABILITY

The average depth of rain in Rome during the period 1862-1877 was greater than, for example, London. In Rome there were, however, huge seasonal fluctuations in this value. There was a considerable difference in rain content between the wettest and the driest month of the year, and sometimes extremely heavy rains concentrated in just a few hours. These variations between dry summers and wet autumns/winters presented challenges to the Hydraulic Service of Rome. Since 1870, the city has experienced rapid urban growth accompanied by a process of renewal and building of new vital infrastructure, such as combined sewers, which were intended both to drain the city and to remove the city's sewage. It was, however, challenging to integrate these two different tasks into a fixed infrastructure in a city with vast seasonal variations in water flow. Rome's sewers, at times, struggled to cope with the overabundance of water during autumn and winter days with consequent flooding of the lowest parts of the city as pure water was flushed throughout the network to remove waste and sewage during the summer. The paper concludes that the engineering model underlying the construction of Rome's combined sewers was derived from the experience of cities with a different climate, such as Paris and London, but proved less effective in the context of a Mediterranean city.",Author Keywordsseasonswater infrastructuressewersfloodsengineering

Since then, oscillating between hope and despair, the residents of the neighborhood have been waiting for the implementation of this plan, under the pressure of displacement due to both gentrification and the gradual decay of their built environment. With a longitudinal research conducted between 2014 and 2021, this paper aims to get insights into the use of this process as a strategy by local authorities, into its effects on socio-spatial integrity of the built environment and into the potentials that it may hold for the residents. The research methodology depends on semi-structured interviews and site observations that expand over this time period, and integrated with the content analysis of social media posts and news on local newspapers. The study concludes that even though the prolonged waiting process weakens the residents' sense of agency, place attachment and energy for collective resistance, it is not a stagnant situation, but an active condition which perpetually compels the residents to develop new social and spatial tactics not only for solidarity and better communication, but also for re-appropriating a more livable environment.",Author KeywordsUrban RegenerationWaitingTemporalities of gentrificationTacticsIzmirKeywords PlusDISPLACEMENTTIMEPOLITICSRENEWALPLACEYOUTH

However, as urban renewal accelerates, the number of discarded seals is also gradually increasing, which is not in line with the concept of green, energy-saving sustainable development. To gain a better understanding of the pyrolysis and combustion characteristics of sealing strips and facilitate their effective resource utilization and conversion into value-added fuels, we employed thermogravimetry, cone calorimetry, and flue gas spreading test equipment. Typical sealing and filling materials used for external windows of buildings, including EPDM ordinary adhesive strips (EPDM-O), EPDM flame-retardant adhesive strips (EPDM-R), as well as 20-fold expanding graphite strips and 30-fold expanding graphite strips (EG-20 and EG-30), were investigated. Comprehensive evaluations of their pyrolysis behaviors, kinetic parameters, and combustion characteristic parameters were carried out. The results showed that EPDM exhibits good thermal stability, while EG had better demonstrates favorable pyrolysis properties and expansion densification. Average activation energies of EPDM-O and EPDM-R in the combustion phase were 68.35 kJmol-1 and 92.40 kJmol-1, respectively. Moreover, the average activation energies of EG-20 and EG-30 in the expanding combustion phase were 67.42 kJ center dot mol-1 and 68.62 kJ center dot mol-1, respectively. The reaction rate of combustion stage is faster than that of pyrolysis stage. Furthermore, For the combustion, the flame growth index (FGI) of EPDM is greater than that of EG, whereas the flame spread index (FPI) is lower than EG. When EPDM burns, the flame spreads rapidly, while EG expands and generates a large number of wormlike substances, effectively preventing the high temperature from spreading to the interior of the material. Analyses of smoke spreading tests have shown that both EPDM and EG can produce irritating flammable fumes at high temperatures, affecting the environment. These results provide a basis for the development of new materials and contributes to fire safety, smoke management, and personnel escape planning.",Author KeywordsWaste fuelEPDMEGActivation energySmokeKeywords PlusEXPANDED POLYSTYRENETHERMAL-DEGRADATIONRUBBERFLAMMABILITYKINETICSLIFE

High-value reuse technology scheme for all components, including classification and deep processing, is a sustainable development direction of great significance to achieve maximum utilization of CDW. Recent advances in green and ecological regeneration approaches for CDW are systematically elaborated in this review, including reinforcement approaches for recycled aggregates and alkali activated technology for recycled powders. Firstly, the main components of CDW and their characteristics are summarized, and the environmental hazards of CDW are expounded. The resource utilization of CDW is indispensable from the perspective of environmental protection and low-carbon development. Furthermore, the CDW treatment process and regeneration approach are analyzed in detail. The application of CDW in recycled coarse aggregates, fine aggregates, and cementitious materials is sufficiently illustrated in this study. Representative mature and sustainable approaches are evaluated to explore the development prospects of the CDW treatment process in terms of economic feasibility, ecological protection, and technological reform. Finally, based on the comprehensive analysis of the technical advantages of CDW resource utilization, a sustainable, low-carbon, and full-component resource regeneration CDW recycling strategy containing pretreatment, deep treatment, and fine processing is proposed. The multi-process collaboration makes the resource utilization for CDW more systematic and sustainable.

The continuous cycle of planning injustice coupled with economic and physical neglect by planning in communities of color has amounted to what some scholars call slow violence. The healing process from slow violence requires planers to acknowledge, refuse, redo, and repair the harm they caused. We use two case studies from Richmond (VA) and Norristown (PA) as exemplars of healing justice through community accountability (CA). These cases illustrate how community groups are reclaiming their spaces, authentically telling their stories, and engaging in physical, economic, corporal, and cultural healing: moving from spaces of trauma toward healing justice. Unlike systems driven by the White spatial imaginary that have historically resulted in racist policies and programs such as urban renewal and broader global forces such as structural adjustment, CA encourages community-led solutions to problems caused by planners.Takeaway for practiceUrban planners can reimagine their role in creating livable, sustainable spaces by centering healing (and justice) as core objectives in their work. Supporting and engaging communities with a CA framework must begin with acknowledging and truth-telling about past and present harms. Planners must ground their work in spatial imaginaries that reflect the values, needs, and cultures of the people and communities they serve. They must also play an active role in repairing physical, economic, and emotional harms using their influence and resources to dismantle the mechanisms (policies and practices) that created the racial spatial trauma. Engaging these communities in development decisions and codifying planning practices that reduce harm and ensure belonging can promote economic sustainability.",Author Keywordscommunity accountabilityhealing justiceracespatial imaginariestraumaKeywords PlusSPATIAL IMAGINARYVIOLENCEMEXICO

The resulting model is applied to the cities of Guangzhou, Chongqing, and Wuxi before and after rural residential land circulation (RRLC) to determine their resulting changes in welfare and welfare gap. From this, it is found that, after RRLC, the farmers' overall welfare increased by 17.5%, 15.1%, and 23.5% respectively, while the welfare gap of Guangzhou and Wuxi was improved, and Chongqing was decreased.

Considering exemplary LRi in the world, LRi in Germany and Japan attract attention. With the LR method, construction is completed by producing development parcels with all infrastructure facilities in a city. Independent sections in buildings built on produced parcels; commercial, residential etc. are used for different purposes. Unlike world LRi, the LR method is used in larger areas in T & uuml;rkiye. However, in T & uuml;rkiye, development parcels that do not have infrastructure (and it is unknown when the construction will be completed) are also produced. In fact, it is known that there are some problems with T & uuml;rkiye's LRi. As a matter of fact, in order to eliminate these problems, revisions have been frequently made in the legal legislation regarding LR. Although the LR method has been improving and modified, it is still criticized. The aim of this study is to identify and eliminate the deficiencies of the method. A number of different studies were conducted for this purpose. The studies were carried out by geomatics engineers, the only discipline authorized to perform LRi in T & uuml;rkiye. The opinions and suggestions of qualified geomatics engineers who are experts in LR and experts involved in the implementations were taken, the scientific studies produced by researchers were analysed, and all this information was taken into account and evaluated together in the light of world literature.

This study considered the impact of public participation and willingness to adopt green regeneration of old industrial areas and developed an evolutionary game model for the local government and developers. Then, we analyzed the initial strategy and relevant variables of the game through MATLAB (version 2021a) simulation to inform the establishment of green regeneration of old industrial areas. The study results showed that public willingness to use regenerated industrial areas and green preferences could motivate the adoption of green regeneration among developers. The incremental cost of ecological restoration of old industrial areas considerably hinders developers from opting for green regeneration. When the incremental cost exceeds the government's financial subsidies and policy preferences, developers often opt for traditional renovation. Furthermore, punitive measures enforced by local government against developers were found to be more effective than incentives; when the cost of punishment exceeds the incremental cost of ecological restoration, developers often opt for green regeneration. Although the ecological safety concerns in old industrial areas can prompt local governments to opt for stringent regulations and developers for green regeneration at the beginning of the game model, evolutionary stability is not reached.It is necessary to study the green regeneration of old industrial areas as this issue has attained global consensus and is related to the sustainable development of the ecological environment and the improvement of the public quality of life. By modeling a multi-interest game scenario, this paper further clarified the key factors hindering the green regeneration of old industrial areas, which is helpful in solving the practical problems existing in the implementation of such projects and promoting the development of green regeneration in old industrial areas. At the same time, based on the problem of ecological security constraints in the old industrial areas, the research guided by public satisfaction has promoted the development of green regeneration projects in the old industrial areas, effectively improved the current situation of the old industrial areas and its surrounding ecological environment, accelerated the process of urban renewal, and injected new vitality into the construction of national ecological civilization.",Author KeywordsOld industrial areasGreen regenerationEcological safety constraintsSocial publicEvolutionary gameNumerical simulationKeywords PlusURBANSUSTAINABILITYSTAKEHOLDERSPROJECTCITY

By analysing the social network relation-ships of decisionmakers (DMs), such as trust and preference similarity relationships, more effective consensus -reaching mechanisms can be designed. Previous studies developed supervised classification algorithms for DM groups of more than 1000 participants on social networks. However, in large-scale social networks, the social connection relations of DMs cannot be completely investigated as human resources and costs during the decision -making process impose limitations. These DMs cannot be effectively trained to build a classification model, which is referred to as unlabelled DMs and results in a large amount of information being ignored during the model training process, leading to an unfair process that can deepen the conflict amongst experts. To address the information loss problem, this study proposes a semi-supervised learning model for social networks with incomplete trust relations, aiming to effectively absorb the preference information of unlabelled DMs into the classification model, thereby improving the effectiveness of classification management. Specifically, the cost -sensitive semi-supervised support vector machine (SVM) introduced in the inner product space is subsequently used by the DMs' classification model to accurately divide unlabelled DMs. A minimum cost adjustment consensus model is then constructed based on the DM subgroups. Numerical experiments on urban renewal were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The empirical and simulation results demonstrated that the proposed method can decrease total consensus costs for social-network GDM with missing trust relationship information.",Author KeywordsGroup decision and negotiationSocial networkConsensus -reaching processSemi -supervised learningKeywords PlusNETWORKPROPAGATIONFRAMEWORKMECHANISMTAXONOMYTRUSTCOST

The main objective of this research lies in conducting a multidimensional analysis of the causes of rural poverty in China, examining the trends in its evolution, and substantiating the prospects for the development of rural territories within the country. The primary research methods are multidimensional quantitative and qualitative analyses of rural development in China and poverty and its causes. According to the study, rural households' economic well-being is still very low in Central and Western China's 22 provinces and other comparable administrative units. In 2022, per capita disposable income of rural households was 40.9% of the income of urban households nationwide. Compared to the year 2000, the average Engel Coefficient has decreased from 48.3%, indicating a moderately prosperous standard of living, to 33%, an excellent qualitative indicator of a certain improvement in rural living standards. The research uncovered a direct relationship between the income of rural households and regional gross domestic product, exports, budgetary expenditures, and the proportion of secondary and tertiary industries in the local economy.

Laser scanners are capable to capture dense 3D measurements of the environment in a fast and highly accurate way. Therefore, laser scanning data have been widely used for as-built BIM generation. Although research efforts have been made on how to automatically achieve ""Scan-to-BIM "", there are still gaps from applying current solutions to real scenarios. One of the challenges is that some irrelevant point clusters may be wrongly recognized as the desired object in the detection stage. This study presents a novel object verification approach based on deep learning point feature comparison to improve the accuracy of automated BIM reconstruction process. Firstly, a KPConv-based deep neural network is developed and trained to perform 3D point feature computation. Then through comparing point features calculated for extracted point clusters and as -designed BIM generated point clouds, point feature distance maps are generated. Afterwards, to automatically analyze the generated feature distance maps, a dataset including simulated positive and negative instances is created based on ModelNet40. And a tiny neural network is established and trained on the prepared dataset to acquire ability of distinguishment. To validate the feasibility of the proposed technique, experiments were conducted on both artificial point clouds and real scan data collected in one MEP room in a water treatment work in Hong Kong.

The forts and houses of Bahrain are not only important cultural landmarks but also serve as examples of the region's architectural styles. These forts and houses are built using locally-sourced materials, such as coral stone and palm wood, and feature distinctive design elements, such as wind towers, courtyards, and arched windows. Even, they serve as important cultural landmarks and provide valuable insights into the region's building techniques. However, the previous methods that are currently employed for architecture form come within the category of subjective analysis. In order to identify architecture form, identify regional architectural style, and provide a quantitative evaluation, quantitative approaches are essential. In this research study, a novel quantitative features based YOLACT object detection model has been employed. Firstly, the Bahrain architectural heritage forts and houses images have been collected from secondary sources with the ramparts, bastions, gateways, watch towers, large windows, high ceilings, wide front porches feature. Secondly, an image resizing and normalization techniques were used to preprocess the images. The preprocessed images have been used to train the object detection model that indentify the eight forts and houses features. Moreover, the YOLACT model obtained the 599 features of forts and 390 features of houses from preprocessed images directly with several epochs and learning rate. Furthermore, the performance of YOLACT model has been analyzed through precision, recall, F1-score, AP parameters. YOLACT model exhibits high precision (88.75%) and recall (69.44%) for forts features compared to recognize the house features. Therefore, the proposed strategy based on machine learning can be employed as an efficient method to assess architectural forms during the urban renewal process as well as a quantitative tool to extract aspects of regional architectures.",

In order to enhance the management efficiency of these highly complex MEP systems, as-built building information models (BIMs) are being increasingly adopted worldwide. As-built BIMs accurately represent the actual conditions of facilities, making as-built BIM reconstruction significantly important for construction progress tracking, quality assurance, subsequent facility management, and renewal. To create as-built BIMs for MEP systems, laser scanners are widely utilized to capture highresolution images and dense 3D measurements of the environment in a fast and highly accurate manner. Despite research efforts to automatically achieve ""Scan-to-BIM,"" there are still gaps in applying current solutions to real-world scenarios. One of the major challenges are the limited generalization of existing methods to unseen scenarios without proper training or fine-tuning on custom-designed datasets. To address this issue, this study introduces Omni-Scan2BIM, a novel approach powered by large-scale pre-trained vision foundation models. Omni-Scan2BIM enables the recognition of MEP-related components with a single shot by integrating an allpurpose feature extraction model and a class-agnostic segmentation model. Firstly, given only a single image with a reference mask, the visual features are extracted for both the target component and the collected on-site images using the vision foundation model DINOv2. Secondly, through comparing pixel features, similarity maps are generated for the on-site images. The prior points for the class-agnostic segmentation model are sampled from the local maxima of the similarity map. Thirdly, Segment Anything Model (SAM) is leveraged to sequentially segment the target component. Finally, the target component is segmented out in 3D space based on the transformation matrix describing the spatial relationship between the 2D images and the 3D point clouds. Shape analysis and label fusion are conducted for as-built BIM modeling purpose. To validate the feasibility of the proposed technique, experiments were conducted using data collected from a real construction site in Hong Kong. The results demonstrate that the proposed Omni-Scan2BIM approach can easily generalize to unseen components with significantly improved accuracy and efficiency.",Author KeywordsScan-to-BIMBuilding information model (BIM)Point cloudsAs-built modelingVision foundation modelSegment anythingOne-shot learningKeywords PlusPOINTRECONSTRUCTIONBIMEXTRACTIONPIPELINES

Mechanisms and Machine Science (145),2024,0,"Urban development and renewal reduce the performance of shield tunnels and may cause structural safety hazards. Thus, a new plug-in fast connector is developed for shield tunnels to improve structural resilience. The connector does not require additional tightening, and the segment opening and dislocation are small. Taking a 650 mm thick segment as the prototype, this paper conducts the tensile and shearing tests of the plug-in fast connector, to investigate the structural form, material properties, and the force transmission between the connection and concrete segment. In addition, the theoretical value of the connector is employed to compare experimental values. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The insufficient bond strength between the embedded sleeves and concrete causes the fast connector to be pulled out and the tensile failure of concrete is occurred. (2) The yield strength of the connector is about 150 kN, and the failure strength is about 200 kN, which is slightly lower than the design value. (3) With the increase of the shearing displacement, damage occurs inside the embedded sleeves and then the concrete of the upper surface is crushed. Finally, the tightness between CR and sleeves is invalid and the shear strength of each connector is 210 kN. (4) The shear stiffness of the plug-in fast connector is fitted by two straight lines, and K1 and K2 are 2.611 kN/mm and 18.544 kN/mm respectively. (5) The new plug-in fast connector can improve the longitudinal mechanical performance of a shield tunnel. The subsequent research should focus on the selection of materials for embedded sleeves and the bond strength between the sleeve and concrete.",

However, with the extensive construction of infrastructure and rapid expansion of cities, the road updating process is imperative to maintain the high quality of current basic geographic information. Currently, road extraction and change detection are two commonly used methods to solve road updating problems. Most of the existing methods rely on a large number of accurate road labels to generate road information while ignoring the use of quantities of available but incomplete road maps. In our work, we proposed a semisupervised road extraction method specifically for road-updating applications [semi-supervised road updating network (SRUNet)]. In this approach, historical road maps are fused with the latest remote sensing images, and the state of the roads is updated directly. A multibranch network is the core of the method, which consists of three noteworthy parts: the map encoding branch (MEB) proposed for representation learning, the boundary enhancement module (BEM) for improving the accuracy of boundary prediction, and the residual refinement module (RRM) for further optimizing the prediction results. We applied our method to two datasets: the DeepGlobe public dataset and our self-constructed dataset from Zhengzhou and Nanjing. Experimental results show that our method achieves an improvement of 14.37% over the baseline approach. Notably, the addition of historical maps improved the model's performance by 12.4%. Promising results were obtained on the two cities' large-scale road networks. With reliable prediction results and improved performance, we believe that SRUNet is meaningful for a wide range of road renewal applications.",Author KeywordsRoadsFeature extractionData miningRemote sensingVectorsDeep learningUrban areasroad extractionroad updatingsemisupervised learning (SSL)

This study is the first to examine empirically the impact of Israel's policy of absorption and spatial distribution on the formation of homogeneous ghettos of Ethiopians, and the contribution of the government's major housing assistance programs for Ethiopians to solving or exacerbating this problem. The study, structured into four main stages, embraces a mixedmethods research approach drawing on diverse theoretical and methodological frameworks. In the first stage, we use descriptive statistics to introduce the current characteristics of the Ethiopian population in Israel and compare them with those of other marginalized social groups. In the second stage, we analyze the government's various housingassistance programs for the Ethiopian population, focusing on three flagship programs. The third stage analyzes the spatial outcomes of the primary housing-assistance program, which remains active to date. Lastly, through in-depth interviews with policymakers and Ethiopian leaders, we delve into the underlying considerations that lay behind the policy decisions made. The research findings indicate that Ethiopians experience social and economic disadvantages, yet their spatial situation seems to be better than that of other disadvantaged groups, because a significant part of this population apparently enjoys the advantages of living in the center of the country. The findings further show that while the various government housing-assistance programs have elevated homeownership rates among Ethiopians, they have not prevent the formation and proliferation of spatial concentrations of poverty. Nor have they ever provided both the means and the knowledge needed to enable Ethiopians households to enhance their quality of life by moving out of these neighborhoods. To truly address the problem of homogeneous concentrations of poverty, a holistic but tailor-made housing policy is essential. This policy should not simply mirroring the national housing policy, which focuses almost exclusively on homeownership, but rather incorporate diverse policy measures for different populations. A good and just housing policy must take into account the existing spatial dynamic and the core-periphery relations and ensure an environment that provides quality employment and education opportunities alongside social networks that the residents can leverage to increase their social, economic, and cultural capital. Otherwise, the government housing-assistance programs will continue to be mere lip service and too little, too late.",Author KeywordsHousing policyAbsorption policyConcentrated povertyEthiopiansIsraelKeywords PlusRESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTURBAN-RENEWALSOCIAL MIXTEL-AVIVNEIGHBORHOODSDIVERSITYPOLITICSCENTRALIZATIONSEGREGATION21ST-CENTURY

The interaction among multiple assessment indicators in sustainable urban development in Guangzhou, China",JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,DEC 15 2022,3,"To achieve sustainable development, local governments are under enormous pressure to simultaneously achieve the three assessment tasks (TATs) of energy saving, CO2 reduction, and pollution reduction. However, the TATs are often managed by different authorities and have three types of measures (TTMs) that correspond to them. The lack of adequate cooperation between these authorities has led to the inefficient investment of policy resources and even to policy conflicts, and the interactions among the TTMs are not yet known. To this end, this paper uses the MCEE model to assess the interactions among the TTMs quantitatively using Guangzhou, China, as a case study. The results showed the following. (1) According to the current development trend, if the authorities managing the TATs continue to work alone, they will not be able to fulfill the corresponding assessment tasks in the future. (2) The TTMs have interactions with each other, and their synergies are far greater than their trade-offs. From 2015 to 2035, it is expected that energy-saving measures can accomplish 54.39% of the CO2 reduction tasks and 32.74% of the pollution reduction tasks indirectly, and low-carbon measures can accomplish 55.53% of the energy saving tasks and 27.20% of the pollution reduction tasks indirectly, However, environmental -protection measures will cause fewer trade-offs (energy demand and CO2 emissions increase by 3.76% and 2.88%, respectively). (3) In some years, the contribution of interactions among the TTMs are even higher than their direct contribution to the TATs.

Once the advantages and functionality of the system have been ascertained, however, it is necessary to evaluate the real applicability in real conditions within companies through the creation of smart systems. The SMARTAP project (founded by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development) arises from the need of small/medium agricultural companies to address the problems related to agricultural practices that do not allow high production yields in small areas, the need to manage fertilizers and phytosanitary products when the company focus aims at producing high quality products and the need to maximize the efficiency of use of water and nutrients resources. The project activities involved the synergistic management of different species of fish and traditional and phytoalimurgical crops grown on different combined hydroponic systems (media-bed, floating system and vertical farming) at company scale. Furthermore, the evaluation of productivity and Internet of Things management to monitor the systems and the economic sustainability were considered. The project therefore proposes an operational model based on sustainability through the use of innovative agricultural practices; this to become profitable for small farms and eco-compatible both from the energy saving and environmental point of view following the circularity of the nutritional resources used.

Consequently, the importance of seismic risk mitigation of earthquake-prone structures has arisen to reduce the primary and secondary losses resulting from seismic events in the last decades as developments in the earthquake engineering field occur. The first step for ensuring seismic resilience is the identification of risky buildings, which is a difficult challenge for metropolises like Istanbul since the building stock consists of over a million buildings. Applying code-based detailed assessments to so many buildings is not practical in terms of time and cost. Moreover, the current code-based detailed assessment methodologies such as Provisions for the Seismic Risk Evaluation of Existing Buildings under Urban Renewal Law (2019) and Turkish Building Earthquake Code (2018) provide discrete predictions for existing buildings as either risky or non-risky or satisfying life safety/controlled damage or not.
